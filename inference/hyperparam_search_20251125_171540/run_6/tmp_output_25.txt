 is a common question that many people ask. The answer to this question is Marie Antoinette.
Marie Antoinette was the Queen of France from 1774 until her execution in 1793 during the French Revolution. She was known for her extravagant lifestyle and her role in the downfall of the monarchy.
The quote "Let them eat cake" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but it is actually a misquote. The original quote was "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche" which translates to "Let them eat bread" in English. This quote was said by Marie Antoinette's mother, Queen Maria Antonia, in response to the poor people of France who were starving.
Despite this, the quote has become synonymous with Marie Antoinette and is often used to criticize her for her perceived lack of empathy towards the poor. However, it is important to remember that the quote was never actually said by Marie Antoinette and that she was not responsible for the French Revolution or its aftermath. [end of text]
