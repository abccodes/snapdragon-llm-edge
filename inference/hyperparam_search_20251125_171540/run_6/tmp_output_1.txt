 is a question that many people have. Fortune cookies are often associated with Chinese cuisine, but their actual origin is not as straightforward as it seems.
The first recorded use of fortune cookies in the United States was in 1907, when they were served at a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco. However, it is believed that the concept of fortune cookies originated in Japan, where they are known as "omamori" or "lucky cookies."
The Japanese tradition of giving omamori to customers dates back to the Edo period (1603-1868), when merchants would give their customers small, paper envelopes containing good wishes and prayers. These envelopes were often decorated with auspicious symbols and designs.
In the early 20th century, Japanese immigrants began bringing their traditions to the United States, including the practice of giving omamori to customers. As Chinese restaurants became more popular in the United States, they began incorporating the concept of fortune cookies into their menus.
Today, fortune cookies are a popular treat at Chinese restaurants and are often associated with Chinese cuisine. However, their actual origin is not as straightforward as it seems, and they have roots in both Japan and China. [end of text]
