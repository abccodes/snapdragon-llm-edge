 This question is often asked to test one's knowledge of physics and their ability to reason logically. The answer, however, may surprise some people.
The Empire State Building stands at 1,454 feet tall, making it one of the tallest buildings in the world. If a penny were dropped from the top of the building, it would fall for approximately 8 seconds before hitting the ground. During this time, the penny would accelerate due to gravity, which is approximately 32 feet per second squared.
At the end of its fall, the penny would be traveling at a speed of around 100 miles per hour, or about 140 kilometers per hour. This speed is fast enough to cause serious injury if it were to hit someone.
However, the impact of the penny on the ground would likely be much less severe than might be expected. The Empire State Building is made of reinforced concrete and steel, which can withstand significant forces. Additionally, the building's foundation is designed to absorb the energy of falling objects.
In conclusion, while a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building would fall at a speed of around 100 miles per hour, the impact on the ground would likely be much less severe
