 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question is not straightforward, as there are several layers of infrastructure and natural features beneath the airport.
The first layer of the airport is the surface, which includes the runways, taxiways, and aprons where planes take off and land. Below this layer, there are several layers of soil and rock that make up the bedrock beneath the airport.
One of the most significant layers beneath the Denver Airport is the Ogden Formation, which is a layer of sedimentary rock that extends from Colorado to Utah. This formation is made up of sandstone, shale, and limestone, and it is believed to be around 250 million years old.
Another layer beneath the airport is the Denver Basin, which is a large depression in the Earth's surface that extends from the Rocky Mountains to the Front Range. The basin is filled with sedimentary rocks, including sandstone, shale, and limestone, and it is thought to have been formed by the movement of tectonic plates.
In addition to these natural layers, there are also several man-made structures beneath the airport, including utility lines, drainage systems, and underground parking garages. These structures are necessary for the operation of the airport
