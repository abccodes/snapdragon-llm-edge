The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have conducted extensive research on MSG and have concluded that MSG is safe for human consumption at levels up to 10 grams per kilogram of body weight. This means that a person weighing 70 kilograms can consume up to 700 milligrams of MSG without any adverse effects.

In addition, many studies have shown that MSG has no significant impact on the nervous system or other organs in small doses. Some studies have even suggested that MSG may have some health benefits, such as improving memory and cognitive function.

However, it is important to note that MSG can cause some people to experience symptoms such as headache, nausea, and flushing when consumed in large quantities or by individuals who are sensitive to MSG. These symptoms are generally considered to be harmless and will resolve on their own within a few hours.

In conclusion, MSG has been scientifically proven to be safe for human consumption
