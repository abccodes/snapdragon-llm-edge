 is a question that many people have. Watermelon seeds are often discarded after eating the flesh, but they can be eaten as well.
Watermelon seeds are rich in nutrients such as protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. They also contain various phytochemicals, which may have health benefits.
However, it is important to note that watermelon seeds should not be consumed excessively. Eating too many seeds may cause digestive problems such as bloating, gas, and constipation. Additionally, some people may be allergic to watermelon seeds, so it is recommended to consult a doctor before consuming them if you have any allergies.
In conclusion, while watermelon seeds can provide various nutrients and potential health benefits, they should not be consumed excessively or by individuals with certain medical conditions. It is always best to consult a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet. [end of text]
