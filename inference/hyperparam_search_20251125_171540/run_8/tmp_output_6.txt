 is a common question that people often ask. However, there is no definitive answer to this question as the percentage of the brain that a human typically uses varies depending on various factors such as age, gender, and individual differences.
In general, it is believed that humans only use a small portion of their brains, with estimates ranging from 10% to 20%. However, recent research suggests that this may not be the case. Studies have shown that different parts of the brain are active during various tasks, and that certain regions of the brain are more active than others.
It is also worth noting that the concept of "using" a part of the brain is somewhat misleading. The brain is constantly active, even when we are at rest, and it is involved in many different functions such as perception, memory, and thought. Therefore, it may be more accurate to say that the brain is always "working" rather than using a specific percentage.
In conclusion, there is no definitive answer to the question of what percentage of the brain humans typically use, as this varies depending on various factors. However, recent research suggests that the brain is more active than previously thought, and that different regions of the brain are involved in many different functions. [end of text]
