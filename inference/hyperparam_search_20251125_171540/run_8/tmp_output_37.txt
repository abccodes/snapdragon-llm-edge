 is a question that has been asked by many people. The answer to this question is that Walt Disney's body was never found after his death in 1966.
Walt Disney died at his home in Malibu, California on December 21, 1966. He had been suffering from lung cancer for several years and was in poor health at the time of his death. His body was taken to a mortuary in Los Angeles and then transported to an undisclosed location for burial.
The location of Walt Disney's burial site has never been made public. Some people have speculated that his body was buried in a secret location, while others believe that it was simply cremated. However, there is no definitive answer to this question and the exact location of Walt Disney's burial remains unknown.
It is worth noting that Walt Disney was a very private person and did not want his death to be made public. He had always been careful about who knew about his personal life and his health, and it is likely that he would have wanted the same for his body after he died. [end of text]
