The position of the Sun in the zodiac at birth is known as the Ascendant or Rising Sign. It is considered to be the most important aspect of a person's horoscope because it represents their personality and how they present themselves to the world. The Sun is associated with self-esteem, confidence, and personal power, so its position in the zodiac can provide insight into a person's strengths and weaknesses.
