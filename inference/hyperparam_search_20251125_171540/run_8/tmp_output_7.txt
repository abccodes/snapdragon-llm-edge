 This question is often asked to test one's knowledge of physics and their ability to reason logically. The answer, however, may surprise some people.
If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, it would not cause any significant harm. The penny would fall at a speed of approximately 120 miles per hour (193 kilometers per hour) and would have enough energy to break your bones if it hit you directly. However, the impact would be relatively minor compared to other objects that could fall from such a height.
The Empire State Building is approximately 1,454 feet (443 meters) tall, so a penny dropped from the top would take about 26 seconds to reach the ground. During this time, it would experience air resistance and slow down slightly, but it would still be traveling at a speed of around 80 miles per hour (129 kilometers per hour) when it hits the ground.
In conclusion, while a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building could potentially cause harm if it hit you directly, the impact would likely be relatively minor compared to other objects that could fall from such a height. The penny would fall at a speed of
