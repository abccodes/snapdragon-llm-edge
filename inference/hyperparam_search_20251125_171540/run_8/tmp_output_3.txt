 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question can vary depending on the type of chili pepper, but generally speaking, the hottest part of a chili pepper is the seeds and the white membrane surrounding them.
The reason for this is that these parts contain the highest concentration of capsaicin, which is the compound responsible for the spicy taste of chili peppers. Capsaicin is also what makes chili peppers hot, so it's no surprise that the hottest part of a chili pepper is also the most flavorful.
It's worth noting that while the seeds and white membrane are generally considered to be the hottest parts of a chili pepper, some varieties of chili peppers have other parts that can be equally or even more spicy. For example, the flesh of certain chili peppers can be very hot, especially if it has been exposed to heat or sunlight.
Overall, while the seeds and white membrane are generally considered to be the hottest part of a chili pepper, it's important to remember that the spiciness of a chili pepper can vary depending on the type of chili pepper and how it has been prepared. [end of text]
