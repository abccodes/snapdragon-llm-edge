 asks a curious child. To answer this question, we need to understand the biology and anatomy of earthworms.

Earthworms are segmented worms that live in soil and are important decomposers in ecosystems. They have a simple body structure with three main parts: the head, the middle section, and the tail. Earthworms also have a digestive system that helps them digest their food, which consists mainly of organic matter found in the soil.

When an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will not survive for long. The reason for this is that earthworms do not have a circulatory system to pump blood throughout their bodies. Instead, they rely on diffusion to transport oxygen and nutrients to their cells. When an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves are separated from each other, and the diffusion process becomes inefficient.

Additionally, earthworms have a nervous system that controls their movements and responses to stimuli. However, when an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will not be able to communicate with each other, and they will not be able to coordinate their movements or respond to external stimuli.

In conclusion, if an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will not survive for long due
