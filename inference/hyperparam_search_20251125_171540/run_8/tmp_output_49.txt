: Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is known as the "Planet of Limits" due to its slow rotation and cold temperatures. In astrology, Saturn is associated with discipline, responsibility, and structure. People born under Saturn are often seen as hardworking, disciplined, and focused on their goals.

However, Saturn can also be associated with limitations and challenges, as it represents the constraints and obstacles that we face in life. People born under Saturn may feel a sense of pressure or burden to achieve their goals, and they may struggle with self-doubt or perfectionism.

Overall, being born under Saturn means that you have a strong work ethic and a commitment to discipline and structure. You may also be faced with challenges and obstacles along the way, but your determination and perseverance can help you overcome them. [end of text]
