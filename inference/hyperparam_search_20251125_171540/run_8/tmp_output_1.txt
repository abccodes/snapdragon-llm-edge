 is a question that many people have. Fortune cookies are often associated with Chinese cuisine, but their actual origin is not as straightforward as one might think.
The first fortune cookie was reportedly created in 1894 by a Japanese immigrant named David Yen in San Francisco, California. However, it is believed that the concept of fortune cookies may have originated in China before being introduced to Japan and then to the United States.
Fortune cookies are made by rolling dough into thin sheets and filling them with a sweetened almond paste or other ingredients. The sheets are then folded into a small square and baked until crisp. Once cooled, the cookies are often decorated with colorful paper or foil.
Today, fortune cookies are enjoyed around the world and are often given as a gift on special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, and holidays. They have become an integral part of Chinese-American culture and are often associated with Chinese cuisine, even though their actual origin is not as straightforward as one might think.
