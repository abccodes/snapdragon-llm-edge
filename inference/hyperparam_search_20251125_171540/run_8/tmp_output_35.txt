 is a question that can be answered by looking up the news from that year. However, it's not a straightforward task to find the answer because the information may be spread across different sources and may require some filtering and analysis to extract the relevant details.
To answer this question, we need to identify the key events or milestones that CERN achieved in 2012. One of the most notable events was the discovery of the Higgs boson, which was a major breakthrough in particle physics research. This discovery was made by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN.
Another significant event in 2012 was the announcement of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) upgrade, which would increase its energy and improve its precision. The LHC is one of the most powerful particle accelerators in the world and plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of fundamental physics.
In addition to these events, CERN also conducted various research projects and collaborations with other institutions around the world. These projects included studies on dark matter, neutrino oscillations, and the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model.
Overall, 2012 was a year of significant progress and achievement for CERN, as it continued to push the boundaries
