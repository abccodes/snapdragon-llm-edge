 Fortune cookies originated in China and were brought to the United States by Chinese immigrants. They have become an iconic part of American culture, often served at the end of a meal as a good luck message or joke.
Fortune cookies are usually made from flour dough that is flattened into thin sheets and then filled with a sweetened cookie batter or other ingredients like chocolate chips or nuts before being baked until crispy. Once they're done baking, the fortune cookie is typically wrapped in colorful paper to hide its contents from diners.
The fortunes inside the cookies can be anything from happy sayings and good luck messages to puns and jokes. They are often used as a way for people to express their wishes or desires for others after a meal, but they have also become a popular gift item and collectible item in recent years.
