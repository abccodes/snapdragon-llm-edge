### Explanation:

1. **Myth vs. Reality**:
   - Commonly believed myth: Humans only use 2% of their brains.
   - Scientific reality: This myth has no basis in factual research or current understanding of brain function and capacity.

2. **Brain Functionality**:
   - The human brain is incredibly complex, with billions of neurons connected by trillions of synapses. 
   - Every part of the brain is involved in various functions at different times.
   
3. **Neuronal Plasticity**:
   - Neurons can form new connections and adapt throughout life through a process called neuronal plasticity. This means that even if some areas of the brain are less active, they can still be engaged to varying degrees depending on activities and experiences.

4. **Usage Patterns**:
   - While it's true that not all parts of the brain are equally active at any given moment, there is no specific percentage figure indicating which part or how much of the brain is typically used.
