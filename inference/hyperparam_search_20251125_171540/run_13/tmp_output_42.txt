 is one of those questions that has been asked for centuries. Many believe that if you break a mirror, seven years bad luck will come your way.
But what do we actually know about the superstition and where did it originate?
The origins of this superstition are not known with certainty but some people suggest that they might have originated in Egypt around 100 B.C. The ancient Egyptians believed that mirrors were a window to the divine, as well as tools for divination.
Another theory suggests that the belief may have come from European witchcraft traditions where breaking a mirror was considered an act of witchcraft and could bring bad luck.
The most popular explanation is that it comes from the Bible. According to some interpretations, there are seven references in the Old Testament to mirrors being broken or shattered (Proverbs 27:19; Isaiah 49:17; Jeremiah 50:8; Ezekiel 36:20; and Hosea 5:13).
However, it is worth noting that these interpretations are not universal among scholars.
Today, many people do not take the superstition seriously and consider it to be purely a matter of superstitious thinking. Nevertheless, some still believe in its power
