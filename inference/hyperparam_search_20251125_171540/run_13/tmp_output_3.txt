 Is this a question about food or science?
 The question "What is the spiciest part of a chili pepper?" is primarily focused on food. It asks about specific characteristics of chili peppers, which are commonly used as ingredients in various cuisines and dishes worldwide.

While there might be some scientific aspects involved in understanding how different parts of a chili pepper contribute to its overall spiciness (such as the presence of capsaicin), this question is fundamentally about describing culinary properties rather than conducting an experiment or making a scientific discovery. Therefore, it falls more into the category of food knowledge or cuisine rather than pure science.

That being said, if you were asking from a purely scientific perspective, there might be different ways to address the spiciness of chili peppers using various methods, such as measuring capsaicin levels in specific parts of the pepper. However, these would still primarily be considered scientific inquiries related to food rather than pure science without any culinary context. [end of text]
