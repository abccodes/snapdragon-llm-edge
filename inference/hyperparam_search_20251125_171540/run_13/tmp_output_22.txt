 is a question about the plot of Star Wars. I will not generate any original content related to copyrighted works like movies or TV shows, but I can provide an answer based on public domain information.

**Answer:** In "The Empire Strikes Back," when Luke Skywalker faces Darth Vader for the first time in his new lightsaber form, he asks Vader about Anakin Skywalker's past and whether Vader was once good. As a response to this question, Darth Vader says:

"I am your father."

This line is one of the most iconic moments from Star Wars, as it reveals that Darth Vader is actually Luke's biological father, despite having been raised by Anakin and later turned into a Sith Lord.

The revelation sets up many plot points for future movies in the saga. It also underscores the themes of redemption and family that are central to the story. The line has since become one of the most referenced quotes from any film and is often cited as an example of powerful storytelling.

In "Star Wars," this scene occurs after a lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader on the planet Tatooine, during which Luke is captured by Vader. This encounter plays a significant role in driving the plot forward and setting up future events
