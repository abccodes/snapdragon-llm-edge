 asked my 8-year-old daughter. I was tempted to answer her question with the same level of confidence that I had when telling her about how many seconds it takes for light to travel around the Earth, but I decided against it.
Instead, I explained that there are so many variables involved in answering this question - factors like weight and density, as well as air resistance and elasticity - that a precise answer is impossible. It's an intriguing problem to think about though!
I also pointed out that while it might sound interesting to know the exact force of impact if you were hit by a penny dropped from such a great height, in reality, it wouldn't be very dangerous at all.
That made her smile and I knew she understood my point. But as we continued our conversation, I couldn't help but think about how many more questions she would have for me about science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
As someone who has worked with children in STEM education, I know that curiosity is an important part of the learning process.
But it's not just curiosity itself that drives them forward. It's also a desire to understand why things happen - that desire to be able to predict and control outcomes.
