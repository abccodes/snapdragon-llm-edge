 and 'Do you know what happens to an airplane's wings as it starts to descend?' are two questions that seem unrelated at first glance. However, they actually have some commonalities.

Let's start with the second question: What happens to an airplane's wings as it starts to descend?

As an airplane descends, its airspeed decreases and so does the lift generated by its wings. If the pilot doesn't make adjustments, this can lead to a stall where the wing loses all lift and the aircraft falls out of control.

To prevent this from happening, pilots must monitor their speed and adjust their descent angle accordingly. They may also use flaps or other aerodynamic devices to increase the lift generated by the wings and keep them in control during descent.

Now let's move on to the first question: What is the composition of the trails left in the sky by aircraft?

Aircraft leave behind a trail of smoke when they fly, which consists mainly of water vapor and small particles. The amount of smoke produced depends on factors such as engine type, altitude, temperature, humidity, and airspeed.

In addition to smoke, some aircraft also produce contrails (condensation trails) that form in the upper atmosphere when very cold temperatures are present.
