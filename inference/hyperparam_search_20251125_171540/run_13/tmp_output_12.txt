 Answer: John Lennon. Is this answer correct? No.
 melody was not written by John Lennon. The song "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" predates him and has been popular for centuries before his time.

The original authorship is unknown, but it's believed to have originated in the late 18th century or early 19th century as a nursery rhyme or folksong.

While John Lennon did compose another well-known song with that title ("Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"), which was released on the album "Imagine" in 1972, it is not the same tune associated with this famous children's song. [end of text]
