In reality, it's not entirely clear why bullfighters use red cloths. The most likely explanation is that bulls are naturally attracted to bright colors, and red is one of them.
Many people believe that red can cause anger in animals but there is no scientific evidence for this claim. Bulls may attack a matador simply because they don't understand what he's trying to do or why he's waving the cape.
The use of red cloths has been around for centuries, and it's believed that its origins date back to Roman times when gladiators used colored cloths as targets during their battles with wild animals. The tradition was later adopted by bullfighters in Spain.
Today, most bullfighting arenas are equipped with special nets or panels that simulate the appearance of a red cape without actually using one. This is done to protect spectators and make it easier for the matador to perform his duties.
However, some people still believe that using real red cloths is an important part of the tradition, and they continue to use them during bullfights around the world. [end of text]
