 This is a common question. The answer is yes, and here are some key details:
In July 1969, NASA's Apollo 11 spacecraft carried astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins to the lunar surface.
On July 20th, Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, saying "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
Aldrin followed him a few minutes later, becoming the second person in history to walk on the moon. Their mission lasted about two and half hours.
Collins remained in lunar orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin explored the surface of the moon. They spent 21 hours total on the lunar surface before returning to Earth on July 24th.

The Apollo program was a significant achievement for NASA, showcasing their technological capabilities and demonstrating that humans could explore other worlds beyond Earth.
It's worth noting that there have been some conspiracy theories suggesting that the moon landings were faked or staged. However, these claims lack credible evidence and are generally considered to be pseudoscience by most experts in the field of astronomy and history. [end of text]
