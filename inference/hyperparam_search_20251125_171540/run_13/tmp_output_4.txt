If there are signs of distress or danger, such as if they were found wandering in extreme weather conditions or near a body of water, reporting immediately is crucial to prevent any potential harm.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: As soon as possible.

```python
# Define the function to evaluate the correctness of an answer choice
def check_answer(choice):
    # Check each option against the expected answer
    if choice == 'D':
        return True  # Correct answer
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
print(check_answer('As soon as possible'))  # Should output: True
```

This solution demonstrates how to create a simple function in Python that evaluates whether an input option matches the correct answer. The function returns `True` if the choice is
