A: If you open an umbrella inside, it may make a big mess. The water from the rain will fall on people and things, causing them to get wet or messy. It's not nice to have wet clothes or furniture at home, so we should close the umbrella before entering a building. Besides, if someone is using a phone or computer indoors, opening an umbrella could cause it to short-circuit because of water droplets on its surface.
B: If you open an umbrella inside, nothing will happen. Umbrellas are designed for use outside in rain, so they can handle the elements without any problem. You can even close your eyes and hold the umbrella up over your head when indoors, and no one will know it's there. It won't make a mess or cause any trouble.

This could lead to the water dripping off the top and making a mess.
