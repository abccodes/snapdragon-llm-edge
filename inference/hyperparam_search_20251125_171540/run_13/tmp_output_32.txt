 was a question asked by many people. The answer to this question can give us an idea of what kind of infrastructure there is under the airport. Here's what we know:

1. There are several underground structures in the area around the airport, including utility lines and drainage systems.

2. A large underground storage facility called the Denver Regional Transportation Authority (DRTA) Storage Facility was built beneath the airport to store baggage for travelers who are waiting for their flights to be rescheduled or delayed due to bad weather conditions or other reasons.

3. There is also a large underground bunker called the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building, which is located in a secure area of the airport and serves as a command center during emergencies.

4. The Denver International Airport Authority has been working on plans for an expansion project that would include additional underground structures to accommodate increased passenger traffic. These plans are still under development, but they could potentially result in even more infrastructure being built beneath the airport in the future.
In summary, there is quite a bit of infrastructure below the Denver International Airport, including utility lines, drainage systems, baggage storage facilities, and emergency shelters. As the airport continues to grow and expand, it's likely that there will be even more underground
