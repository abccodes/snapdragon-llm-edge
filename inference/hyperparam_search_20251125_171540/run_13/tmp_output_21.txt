 

The exact words spoken by the Queen to her magic mirror in the 1937 animated classic "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" are:

"I'm melting, I'm melting!
Who's fairest of them all?"
However, it should be noted that these lines were later changed for a more family-friendly version. In some versions, the Queen asks her mirror to tell her if Snow White is prettiest than any other girl. The exact wording varies between different adaptations and translations. [end of text]
