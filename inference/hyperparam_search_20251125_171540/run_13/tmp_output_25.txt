 Marie Antoinette, who was the Queen of France during the French Revolution, is often quoted as having said “Let them eat cake” in response to a complaint about food prices. However, this quote has been debated for centuries and there is no conclusive evidence that she ever actually said it.
In fact, many historians believe that the quote originated from an 18th-century British political cartoonist named William Hogarth. The cartoon depicted Marie Antoinette as a frivolous queen who was uninterested in the plight of her subjects. In the background, a peasant woman is holding up a loaf of bread and crying out, "Give us some bread!" While the king stands by doing nothing.
The caption below the drawing reads, “Let them eat cake,” which has been interpreted as a mocking reference to Marie Antoinette’s perceived lack of concern for her people's suffering. However, it is important to note that this quote was not actually said by Marie Antoinette and there is no evidence to suggest that she ever uttered these words.
In conclusion, while the quote “Let them eat cake” has become a symbol of Marie Antoinette’s perceived cruelty towards the French peasantry during the Revolution, there is no conclusive proof
