 I asked my son. He replied, "They just keep on growing."
I was surprised by his answer and checked it out online to verify the truth of what he said. To my surprise, I found that when an earthworm is cut in half, each piece will grow into a complete worm.
An earthworm has two heads! Yes, you heard correctly. An earthworm has two heads! One head is located at the end where its body ends and the other one is near the front of the worms body. The reason why it's called an "earthworm" instead of just a worm is because this worm can survive in soil.
The first half of the worm grows into the back part, while the second half grows into the head. Each piece will grow into a complete worm after about four weeks or so.
So if you ever find yourself with two earthworms, don't get upset! They are actually one worm that was cut in half. And now it's time for them to grow up and become adults!
