 The quote was attributed to Albert Einstein. However, it has been suggested that there is no reliable evidence of this attribution.
The statement "Insanity is repeating the same actions over and over and expecting a different result" is often used as an example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because something happened after another event, it was caused by that other event, without considering alternative explanations.
However, it's important to note that this statement does not necessarily imply that Einstein himself said it or is related to him in any way. The quote has been attributed to many different people over the years and may have originated from a variety of sources.
In conclusion, while the attribution to Albert Einstein is often cited, there is no reliable evidence to support this claim. It's important to remember that attributing quotes to specific individuals can be difficult and should always be verified with credible sources before accepting them as fact. [end of text]
