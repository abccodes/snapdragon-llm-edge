 Answer: The trails are composed mainly of water vapor, with some contrails also containing other substances such as ice crystals and soot. Contrail formation occurs when warm moist air from an airplane mixes with cold dry air at high altitudes, causing condensation to form around tiny particles or nuclei in the atmosphere. These particles can be dust, salt crystals, or even volcanic ash. The resulting contrails appear white because they reflect sunlight.
