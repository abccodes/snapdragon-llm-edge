Assistant: The quote "Only the dead have seen the end of war" is often attributed to A. J. Cronin, an Irish author known for his novels set in Ireland during and after World War II. However, it's important to note that while this attribution is widely accepted, there isn't definitive proof that he said it exactly as written.

Despite this uncertainty, the quote has become closely associated with Cronin due to its frequent use in discussions about war and peace. Therefore, for practical purposes, A. J. Cronin can be considered the correct answer if asked specifically about who is commonly attributed with this particular phrase. [end of text]
