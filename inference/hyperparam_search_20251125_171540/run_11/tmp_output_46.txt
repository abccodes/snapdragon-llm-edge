 This is the question that many people ask themselves when they come across a single coin.
The answer to this question depends on where you are. In some countries, such as the United States, picking up a penny found on the ground can be considered stealing because pennies have no intrinsic value. However, in other countries like Canada and Australia, finding a penny is not illegal and it's acceptable to keep it.
In any case, if you find a penny and decide to pick it up, make sure that you are aware of your local laws and regulations regarding the matter. It's always better to be safe than sorry! [end of text]
