 This is a question that many parents ask their children. The answer may surprise them.
Sitting too close to the TV can cause eye strain, headaches and other vision problems.
According to research conducted by the American Optometric Association (AOA), sitting closer than 24 inches from a standard definition television screen can increase the risk of eye strain and discomfort.
