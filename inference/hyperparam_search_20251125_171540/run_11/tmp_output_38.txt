 is a question that can be answered using the following code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=categories&inpage=Barack+Obama"
response = requests.get(url)
result = response.json()
print(result['category1']['name'])
```

This code uses a Python library called `requests` to make an HTTP GET request to the Wikipedia API. The query parameter is set to "action=query" and "prop=categories", which returns all categories of pages that link to Barack Obama.

The result is then printed out, which should be "Category:People born in Hawaii". This indicates that Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, a state in the United States. [end of text]
