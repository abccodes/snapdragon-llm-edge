 It's not necessarily true that insanity is always defined as doing something repeatedly, but rather it can be seen as any behavior or pattern of thinking or feeling that causes significant distress, impairment in functioning, or harm to oneself or others. While the quote you mentioned does reflect a common understanding of insanity, there are many different ways to define and understand it.

Some other examples include:

1. "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results" - attributed to Albert Einstein.
2. "A man who never made a mistake never tried anything new." - Thomas Edison
3. "The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible." - Albert Einstein

These quotes highlight the idea that innovation, creativity, and risk-taking are often seen as essential to making progress in various fields, including science, technology, and art.

It's worth noting that while these quotes may reflect common beliefs or opinions about insanity, they do not necessarily represent a scientific definition of the term. In many cases, diagnosis of mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression is based on specific criteria outlined in medical textbooks or by healthcare professionals.

Overall, understanding and defining madness can be complex and nuanced
