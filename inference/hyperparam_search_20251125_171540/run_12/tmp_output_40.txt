 Aircraft leave a trail in the sky that can be observed from below or above, and this trail is made up of various particles. The composition of these particles will depend on factors such as the type of fuel burned by the aircraft, the altitude at which it flies, and whether any exhaust gases are emitted.
In general, aircraft trails consist mainly of water vapor. This occurs because when hot air from an engine mixes with colder surrounding air, condensation takes place and forms clouds or fog. Additionally, some aircraft trails may also contain particulate matter such as soot, dust, and ash particles from the engines or exhaust systems. These particles can contribute to atmospheric pollution and climate change.
