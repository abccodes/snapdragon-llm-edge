: NASA's Apollo program was a series of space missions that successfully landed humans on the Moon between June 20, 1969 and December 14, 1972. The most famous mission of this program is the Apollo 11 lunar landing in which Neil Armstrong became the first human to step foot on the moon's surface.

However, there are some conspiracy theories that claim humans never really landed on the Moon but were instead filmed and broadcasted from a set in Hollywood or another location.
While these claims have been debunked by numerous scientific studies and evidence, it is worth noting that there remains an ongoing debate among certain circles regarding the authenticity of the Apollo landings. Some people believe that the images and footage are staged and not genuine.

Despite this controversy, many historians and space enthusiasts still consider the Apollo program a remarkable achievement in human history and one of the most significant events of the 20th century. [end of text]
