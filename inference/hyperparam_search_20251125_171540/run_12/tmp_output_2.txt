 asks a young student.
To explain this, let's consider the principles of light refraction and absorption.

1. **Understanding Light**: White light contains all colors in the visible spectrum ranging from red to violet.

2. **Refraction through Water or Air**: When white light enters water or air (like blood inside veins), it bends slightly due to differences in density between air/water and the medium surrounding it (the blood). The angle of refraction depends on the wavelength of the light, which means different colors will bend by slightly different amounts.

3. **Absorption of Light**: Different wavelengths of light have varying absorption rates in biological tissues. For example:
   - Blue light is absorbed more readily than red or green.
   - Red and green light are less strongly absorbed but still pass through.
   
4. **Visible Spectrum**: The visible spectrum that reaches our eyes includes blue, green, yellow, orange, and red wavelengths.

5. **Reflection from Blood**: Veins appear blue because:
   - Blue light is the most strongly reflected back to your eye.
   - Other colors are absorbed by tissues or blood within the vein.

Putting these principles together:
- White light enters through skin and into vessels (vein).
- Red,
