: A human typically uses around 10% of their brain. However, it's worth noting that this figure is often cited as an average and can vary widely from person to person depending on factors such as individual abilities, experiences, and daily activities.

In fact, many researchers argue that humans are capable of utilizing all areas of their brains for various tasks and functions. [end of text]
