A: "Yes, MSG has been scientifically proven to be harmful" - This option suggests that there exists some body of research or study that conclusively proves MSG is harmful even at low levels.

B: "No, it hasn't been scientifically proven to be harmful" - This alternative states the opposite, suggesting no scientific evidence supports a harmful impact of MSG in small doses.

Given this context and options provided:
