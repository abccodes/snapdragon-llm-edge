 The answer to this question is often debated among conspiracy theorists and UFO enthusiasts. While many believe it was a flying saucer, others suggest that it may have been an advanced aircraft or even an extraterrestrial craft.
One of the most well-known theories surrounding the Roswell incident is that it involved an alien spacecraft. According to these theories, the object crashed near Roswell, New Mexico on July 8, 1947 and was secretly taken by government officials for analysis. However, there is no definitive proof of this theory.
Another theory suggests that what crashed during the Roswell incident was a top-secret experimental aircraft called Project Mogul. This project involved testing high-altitude balloons equipped with microphones to detect Soviet nuclear tests. If such an object had indeed been recovered and analyzed, it could have raised questions about its origins and purpose.
Still another theory is that the crash may have been caused by a meteor or asteroid impact. While this explanation seems less likely given the amount of debris allegedly found in the area, some researchers argue that it's possible that other objects have crashed nearby without drawing public attention.
Ultimately, there is no clear answer to what object crashed during the Roswell incident and the mystery remains one of the most famous UFO events
