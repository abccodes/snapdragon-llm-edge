 I asked.

'I get very, very cold,' said my friend.

I remember being a child and having to dry out after swimming or playing at the beach. If it was particularly chilly outside, I would run back home as quickly as possible to change into warm clothes. My mom would always insist on drying off thoroughly with towels before heading indoors because she knew that wet hair in cold weather could lead to chills.

As an adult, I realize that getting your hair wet and then going out in the cold can cause discomfort, but it's not necessarily dangerous unless you don't dry yourself properly. It is important, however, to avoid being too exposed to the elements if your hair is still damp or wet because this could lead to hypothermia.

If you do get caught outside with wet hair and feel chilly, there are a few things that you can try to help warm up:

1. Go indoors: The quickest way to dry off and become warmer is simply to go inside where it's heated. If possible, change into dry clothes as well.
2. Take hot showers or baths: Hot water helps your body warm up by increasing circulation and opening the blood vessels in your skin.

3. Drink warm beverages: Warm liquids like soup or tea
