 Answer: When you cut an earthworm in half, the top part (tail) starts to move around and wriggle. The lower part of the worm that includes its head eventually dies because it doesn’t have a brain or nervous system.
Why does this happen?
The reason for this behavior is related to how Earthworms are constructed.
Earthworms bodies have segments, with each segment being called an annulus. Each annulus has muscles on both sides that help in moving the body along the ground. When you cut an earthworm in half, the upper part (tail) still contains some of these muscle groups which can move and wriggle. The lower part will not have as many muscles or other structures to function properly.
In conclusion, when you cut an Earthworm in half, only the top part (tail) starts moving around because it has some functioning muscles whereas the bottom segment eventually dies due to lack of a brain or nervous system. [end of text]
