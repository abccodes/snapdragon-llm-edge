 What's the answer?

 The hottest part of a chili pepper, and therefore likely to be considered "spicier" by most people, is typically the inside membrane. This membrane contains pungent compounds called capsaicinoids that give chilis their spicy flavor.

However, it's worth noting that the spiciness can vary depending on various factors such as breed of chili pepper, cultivation methods, and how it has been prepared or processed. Some people may find certain areas more "spicy" than others. It's also important to note that while capsaicinoids are responsible for the spicy sensation, they don't actually cause any physical harm; they're simply a natural defense mechanism of chili peppers.
