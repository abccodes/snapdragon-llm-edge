 asked the curious interviewer.

Saturn is a planet in our solar system. Its name comes from a Roman god associated with agriculture and harvests. In astrology, each of the twelve signs of the zodiac – Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces – is represented by one of these planets.

When someone’s birthday falls under a specific sign, it means that planet rules or influences their life. Therefore, the interviewer wanted to know what could be inferred about Saturn's influence on an individual born under this sign.
