 
'the queen's speech is not recorded. The exact line spoken by Queen Elizabeth II in the movie "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" cannot be determined with certainty because it has never been officially released or confirmed, as Disney does not own the rights to any scenes from the film. In addition, there are no reliable sources that provide evidence of the queen's speech in the film. It is therefore impossible to answer this question accurately. [end of text]
