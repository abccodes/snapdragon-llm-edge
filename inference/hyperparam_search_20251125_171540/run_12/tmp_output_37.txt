 a question many people have asked themselves. The truth is that it's located in an unmarked grave at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California.

Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1902, and died on December 30, 1966, after suffering from lung cancer for two years. His body was initially buried in a family plot at Evergreen Cemetery in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. However, following a dispute over the placement of his grave marker, Disney's body was moved to an unmarked grave in the same cemetery.

Disney had long expressed his desire to be buried in California and not at the Elstree Studios in England where he spent most of his career. His son Roy Disney also wanted him interred in the United States for sentimental reasons. Therefore, after a year-long legal battle, his body was finally moved to an unmarked grave on February 20, 1967.

The location of Walt Disney's grave is kept secret as part of Hollywood tradition, and it remains unknown by many people. However, some have speculated that the unmarked grave can be found near a pond in Forest Lawn Memorial Park or between two trees on an old road.
