 and what does it mean?

The phrase "Let them eat cake" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, a French aristocrat who lived during the late 18th century. However, there are several reasons why this attribution may not be accurate.

Firstly, Marie Antoinette did not actually say these words. The quote has been circulating for many years and was first recorded in print by an American journalist named Alexander Hamilton in his book "The Life of Philip II King of Spain" in 1798. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Marie Antoinette ever said this phrase.

Secondly, even if she did say the words, it does not necessarily mean what people think it means today. The French Revolution was a time of great upheaval and social change in France, and Marie Antoinette's role as queen meant that she had to navigate these changes carefully. It is possible that when someone asked her about feeding the poor, she responded with this quote to emphasize the importance of maintaining order and stability.

In conclusion, while "Let them eat cake" has become one of the most well-known quotes associated with Marie Antoinette, there is no evidence to suggest that she actually said these words.
