Chameleons are fascinating creatures known for their ability to change color. The process of changing colors is called chromatophores, which are pigment cells that reside in specialized skin structures called chromatophores.

The primary reason why chameleons change colors is camouflage. Chameleons have the ability to blend into their surroundings by matching the background with their own body color and patterns. This helps them stay hidden from predators or prey.

Chameleons also use color changes for communication purposes. They can show aggression, display sexual interest, or signal fear or submission through different color displays. For example, a chameleon may change to bright colors when it is threatened, while a female chameleon may change colors during mating season to attract males.

In addition, some species of chameleons use color changes for thermoregulation. They can absorb heat from the sun by changing their skin color to darker shades and release heat through lighter hues.

Overall, changing colors is an important survival strategy for chameleons that helps them blend into their surroundings, communicate with other individuals, or regulate their body temperature. [end of text]
