 What is this type of question called?

This type of question is known as a natal astrology query. Natal astrology, also referred to as horoscope or natal chart reading, is a branch of astrological practice that aims to interpret an individual's personal characteristics and potential based on the positions of celestial bodies at the time of their birth.

The position of the Sun in particular is considered highly significant in natal astrology as it represents the core essence of an individual, their identity, their personality traits, and their overall life path. The sign that the Sun falls into during a person's zodiac chart, along with its aspects to other planets, can provide insights into many different facets of their character.

However, it is important to note that natal astrology is not considered a scientific field and there is no empirical evidence to support the accuracy or validity of this practice. Many people find value in exploring astrological interpretations as part of self-discovery or for entertainment purposes, but they should be aware that such beliefs are not based on rigorous research or objective criteria.
