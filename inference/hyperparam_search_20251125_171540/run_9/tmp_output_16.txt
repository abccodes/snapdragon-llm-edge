 asks a child. 'You might get a cold,' replies an adult. But why? What happens to the hair in cold weather?
When the hair is wet, it is in a liquid state. As the temperature drops, the liquid state changes to a solid state. This process is called freezing. When the hair freezes, it becomes brittle and prone to breaking. If the hair breaks, it can cause discomfort or even injury.
In addition to breaking, wet hair can also become tangled or knotted in cold weather. This is because the hair becomes stiff and brittle, making it harder to move and causing it to become tangled.
Overall, going outdoors in cold weather with wet hair can lead to discomfort, injury, and tangling. It is important to dry hair thoroughly before going outside in cold weather to prevent these issues. [end of text]
