 - This question is about the composition of the trails left in the sky by aircraft. The answer to this question is 1. Water vapor 2. Carbon dioxide 3. Sulfur dioxide 4. Nitrogen oxides
1. Water vapor
2. Carbon dioxide
3. Sulfur dioxide
4. Nitrogen oxides

The composition of the trails left in the sky by aircraft is primarily composed of water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. These compounds are produced as a result of the combustion of fuel in the engines of aircraft. Water vapor is the most significant component of these trails, as it is a byproduct of the combustion process. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides are also produced in significant quantities, while sulfur dioxide is produced in smaller amounts. These compounds can have various effects on the atmosphere, including the formation of clouds and the contribution to climate change. [end of text]
