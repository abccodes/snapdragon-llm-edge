"
 Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France during the French Revolution, is often credited with the quote "Let them eat cake!" which is said to have been spoken in response to a plea from a poor woman who was asking for bread. However, historians have since determined that the quote is not actually attributed to Marie Antoinette and is likely a misattribution. The quote is often used to symbolize the perceived callousness of the wealthy to the plight of the poor during the French Revolution. It is important to note that the quote is not historically accurate and should not be taken as a true representation of Marie Antoinette's views or actions. [end of text]
