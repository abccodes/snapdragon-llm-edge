 is a question that many people have asked. The answer is that underneath the Denver Airport there is a large underground parking garage. The parking garage has a capacity of over 14,000 vehicles and is one of the largest underground parking garages in the United States. The garage is located beneath the airport's main terminal and is connected to the terminal by a series of tunnels. The parking garage is used by passengers to store their vehicles while they are at the airport, and by airport employees to store their vehicles while they are working. The garage is also used by local residents and businesses to store their vehicles while they are in the Denver area. The parking garage is an important part of the airport's infrastructure and helps to make the airport more convenient for passengers and airport employees. [end of text]
