 - This question is often asked to test one's knowledge of physics and their ability to calculate the force of impact. The Empire State Building stands at a height of 1,250 feet and a penny dropped from the top would fall a distance of 1,250 feet. The acceleration due to gravity is approximately 32 feet per second squared. Using these values, we can calculate the velocity of the penny when it reaches the ground using the formula: v = sqrt(2gh). Plugging in the values, we get: v = sqrt(2 x 32 x 1,250) = 1,968 feet per second. The force of impact can be calculated using the formula: F = m x v^2, where m is the mass of the penny and v is the velocity. Assuming the mass of the penny is 2.5 grams, we get: F = (2.5 x 10^-3) x (1,968)^2 = 1.5 x 10^6 newtons. This is equivalent to 340,000 pounds of force. Therefore, if you were struck by a penny dropped
