 I'm asking because I'm trying to write a scene where a character is trying to find a way to break the curse, and I want to quote the Queen's exact words. 
 'The exact words that the Queen says to her mirror in the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs are "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"' [end of text]
