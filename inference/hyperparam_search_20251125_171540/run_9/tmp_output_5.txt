 is a question that many people have asked. The answer is quite interesting and revolves around the history and culture of bullfighting.
The red capes, also known as muletas, are not actually meant to hurt the bull. Instead, they are used to distract the bull and make it attack the matador. The capes are made of a special material that is designed to withstand the bull's teeth and horns.
The red color of the capes is also significant. Bulls are naturally attracted to red, so the capes are designed to draw the bull's attention. This makes it easier for the matador to control the bull and perform the necessary moves.
In addition to the capes, matadors also use other weapons, such as lances and swords, to fight the bull. The capes are an important part of the bullfighting ritual and are used to create a dramatic and exciting spectacle for the audience. [end of text]
