 This is a question that many people have asked themselves at some point. The truth is, there is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on various factors.
One factor that may influence the answer to this question is the location of the penny. If the penny is found in a public place, such as a street or park, it may be considered a lost item and the finder may have a legal obligation to turn it in to the proper authorities. On the other hand, if the penny is found in someone's home or on their property, it may be considered their property and the finder may be free to keep it.
Another factor that may influence the answer to this question is the value of the penny. If the penny is worth a significant amount of money, such as a rare coin or a coin from a different country, the finder may have a legal obligation to turn it in to the proper authorities. On the other hand, if the penny is worth only a small amount of money, the finder may be free to keep it.
Overall, the answer to the question "What happens if you find a penny and pick it up? " depends on various factors, including the location of the penny, its value, and any applicable laws
