The organization announced the discovery of the Higgs boson, a particle that had been predicted by physicists for decades but had never been observed. The discovery was made using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator that CERN operates. The Higgs boson is considered to be a key component of the Standard Model of particle physics, and its discovery provided strong evidence for the theory's correctness. The announcement of the Higgs boson discovery was met with great excitement and celebration in the scientific community, and it marked a major milestone in the field of physics. [end of text]
