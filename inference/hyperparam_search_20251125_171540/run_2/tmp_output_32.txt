 - This is a question that many people have asked, and the answer can be a bit surprising. The Denver International Airport, also known as DIA, is one of the busiest airports in the United States, handling over 70 million passengers per year. It is located in the Denver metropolitan area, and its construction began in 1992. The airport is built on a large area of land that was previously used for agricultural purposes, and it is surrounded by the Rocky Mountains. The airport is built on a foundation of bedrock, which is the bed of the river that runs through the area. The bedrock is about 1,000 feet below the surface, and it is made up of granite and sandstone. The airport is also built on a foundation of man-made materials, including concrete and steel, which helps to support the weight of the airport and its many structures.
