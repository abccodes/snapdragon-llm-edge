 This question can be answered by a simple observation. However, the answer can also be given in a more complex way by considering the interaction of light with the Earth's atmosphere.
When viewed from space, the sun appears white. This is because the light from the sun is made up of all the colors of the visible spectrum, and these colors are reflected back to the observer's eye. However, when the sun's light passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it can be affected by various factors.
For example, the Earth's atmosphere can absorb certain colors of light more than others. This can cause the sun to appear yellow or orange during sunrise or sunset. Additionally, the Earth's atmosphere can scatter light in different directions, which can cause the sun to appear brighter or dimmer depending on the observer's location.
Overall, the answer to the question "What color is the sun when viewed from space?" is white, but the appearance of the sun can be affected by the Earth's atmosphere in various ways. [end of text]
