 

The Queen says to her mirror in the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" This is the most famous line from the film, and it is often used as a reference point for beauty and self-esteem. The line has been parodied and referenced in many other works of literature and popular culture. [end of text]
