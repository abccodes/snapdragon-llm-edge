Gandhi was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement and is known for his philosophy of non-violence and pacifism. The statement reflects Gandhi's belief that true peace cannot be achieved by avoiding conflict or danger, but rather by facing them head-on and finding a peaceful resolution through dialogue and understanding.
