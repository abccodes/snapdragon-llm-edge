Earthworms have the ability to regenerate their bodies, and they can grow back the missing half if given the right conditions. This process is called regeneration, and it is a common ability in many animals. However, the regeneration process can be affected by factors such as the size of the cut, the health of the worm, and the availability of nutrients and oxygen in the environment. In general, the larger the cut, the more difficult it will be for the worm to regenerate, and the longer it will take. It is important to note that not all cuts can be fully regenerated, and some may result in the death of the worm. '
