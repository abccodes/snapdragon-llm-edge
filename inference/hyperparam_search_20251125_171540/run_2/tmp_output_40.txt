 I asked a meteorologist friend. 'They are mostly made of tiny water droplets, ' he replied. 'But there is also a small amount of liquid carbon and carbon dioxide.' What are the trails left in the sky by aircraft made of? They are mostly made of tiny water droplets, but there is also a small amount of liquid carbon and carbon dioxide. These trails are called contrails. Contrails are formed when the exhaust gases from aircraft mix with the cold air at high altitudes, causing the water vapor in the exhaust gases to condense into tiny water droplets. The liquid carbon and carbon dioxide in the exhaust gases also contribute to the formation of the contrail. Contrails can last for several hours and can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate. They can reflect sunlight and scatter it, which can cool the Earth's surface. However, they can also absorb heat and contribute to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. Overall, the composition of the trails left in the sky by aircraft is complex and can have both cooling and warming effects on the Earth's climate. [end of text]
