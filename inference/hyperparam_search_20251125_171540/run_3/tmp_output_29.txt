 Answer: The quote "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results" was famously attributed to Albert Einstein by a number of journalists in an attempt to portray him as eccentric. However, there is no record that Einstein ever said or wrote those exact words.
Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century and a key figure in developing the theory of relativity. He won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect." Einstein is often considered one of the greatest scientists who ever lived.
The quote you provided may have originated from another person or source entirely. It's important to remember that many famous quotes are actually apocryphal and attributed incorrectly over time. If you're interested in learning more about Albert Einstein, I highly recommend reading some of his books and papers on the subject.
