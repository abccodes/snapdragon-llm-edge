 was a question posed by one of my students. It's something I've often wondered about too, and I'm delighted to share some information about what really does happen when an earthworm gets split down the middle.
When an earthworm is cut into two halves, each piece continues to grow. The segments that were at the front of the worm are now behind it, but they continue to move forward as if nothing had happened. This growth is possible because every segment contains cells with the ability to differentiate into all types of tissues in a new body.
The head of an earthworm (the part that usually emerges from the soil) doesn't actually have much control over its movement once it's underground. The muscles controlling the tail are stronger than those at the front, so the worm will continue moving forward even if only one half is intact. This characteristic makes worms useful for composting and as fishing bait.
However, earthworms do not survive indefinitely after being split in two. Over time, they become weak due to a lack of coordination and eventually die.
So next time you see an earthworm, remember that it's capable of amazing things – even surviving its own death! [end of text]
