 I asked, feeling nervous. The old man replied, "As long as there's no evil intent behind it, a black cat crossing your path is nothing to worry about." To me, this was akin to the advice my mother gave when I faced difficulties: "If something bad happens, just stay calm and think of an easy solution." My aunt often shared with me a story about her childhood. She said that once she lost a toy rabbit at home and cried for hours until her father came home from work to comfort her. Later, he told her that the reason why nothing happened after she cried was because she was crying so much that it made her feel better.

Based on these stories and advice, I can conclude that encountering black cats or facing difficulties is not something to be afraid of as long as there's no evil intent behind it. A calm and positive attitude will help resolve the situation easily.
