 - A very popular question, and the answer is simple. Red is not the color that attracts bull's attention; it's actually their sense of smell that they use to hunt down food. However, bulls can also be attracted by movement. Therefore, in order for a matador to control his bull effectively during the fight, he waves red capes around him to get its attention.
However, this isn't always the case. In some instances, a matador may wave a blue cape or another colored object instead of a red one. This is because bulls are less likely to react strongly to blue than they are to red. Additionally, some bullfighters have developed their own techniques for controlling their animals during fights, which may involve using different colors or shapes in addition to capes.
Ultimately, the color of the cape used by a matador does not necessarily matter as much as his skill and experience in controlling his animal during the fight. Regardless of what type of object is being waved around him, the goal for any bullfighter is always to remain safe while maximizing their chances of victory against their formidable opponent.
In summary, bulls are attracted by movement rather than color when it comes to hunting food, so a matador waves red capes around himself
