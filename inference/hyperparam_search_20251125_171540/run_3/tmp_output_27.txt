 was a popular question at NASA's press conference. As expected, President Kennedy had died before Armstrong could reach the moon and so NASA chose to send him the message from the White House.
At 10:56 p.m., July 20th, as Apollo 11 descended toward the lunar surface, Armstrong broadcast a famous speech which began with "This is one small step for man. "
What followed were the exact words that made history:
"That's one small step for man, but one giant leap for mankind."
Armstrong concluded his famous line by saying: "...and so ends an era...but the spirit of adventure will forever be remembered by all men who dare to dream." These concluding words captured both the significance and beauty of Armstrong's momentous achievement.
Following these exact words, Armstrong descended from Eagle onto the lunar surface. He was followed shortly after by Buzz Aldrin, making them the first two humans in history to walk on another world.
The moon landing has been called one of humanity's most significant achievements and a turning point in our understanding of space exploration.
As we mark this anniversary 50 years later, let us remember that these exact words will live forever as proof that human dreams can come true. "
