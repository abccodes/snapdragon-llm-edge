In fact, research has shown that all areas of the human brain play important roles in different functions and processes, such as sensory processing, memory formation, language comprehension, decision-making, and more. The idea that we only use a small portion of our brains is therefore just another myth that can be dispelled with some basic knowledge about the structure and function of the brain.
