 What's the answer?

 The hottest part of a chili pepper, commonly known as "the capsaicin," is found in the white membrane or seeds inside the fruit. This concentration of spicy compounds makes it so that even touching these parts can cause intense burning sensations on skin and mucous membranes. 

The specific location within this membrane where most of the spicy elements are concentrated is often referred to as a "hot spot" or "pain point." Some chili peppers have more hot spots than others, with some breeds having hundreds.

In general, people find that touching these parts with bare hands causes the strongest burning sensation, while eating and handling the fruit can also cause irritation due to exposure to saliva. 

It's worth noting that even when consuming a spicy pepper, it's important to be cautious about how much you eat or handle as excessive consumption can lead to intense discomfort and burning sensations in areas such as the mouth, throat, stomach, and eyes. If you experience any unusual symptoms after eating hot peppers, consider drinking plenty of water to help dilute and wash away some of the spicy compounds. [end of text]
