 I asked a teacher in class. She replied that it's because they are transparent and absorb red light, but she didn't know why the answer was incorrect.
You can find an explanation on this website: <http://www.coloroflight.com/why-do-veins-seem-blue.html>. The website states that when you look at a vein in a body part such as the leg or arm, it appears blue because light from above is scattered and absorbed by surrounding tissue, but only red light gets through to your eye.
That makes sense. But then why do veins appear green on my face? My teacher never mentioned this. She also didn't know why her answer was wrong.
The reason veins appear green on the face is that they are closer to the surface of the skin and receive more direct sunlight, which causes them to absorb more red light. This means that only blue light gets through to your eye, making the veins appear green.
I hope this explanation helps clarify the mystery of why veins appear different colors in various parts of the body! [end of text]
