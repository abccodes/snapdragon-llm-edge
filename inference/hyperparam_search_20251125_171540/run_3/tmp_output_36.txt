 Where can I find it on a map?
: The city of Bielefeld is located in Germany. You can find its coordinates as follows:
Bielefeld, Germany: 52°18′36″N 7°40′09″E
You can use these coordinates to locate the city on most online maps.
Alternatively, you could search for "Bielefeld" or "Bielefeld, Germany" in Google Maps. This will display the city and allow you to zoom into it to see its location more clearly.
I hope this helps! [end of text]
