 - I would say that it's a bad idea. Wet hair can easily freeze in cold temperatures, which could cause discomfort or pain when touching the scalp.
To minimize the risk of this happening, it may be best to avoid going outside with wet hair during cold weather. If you must go out, consider wearing a hat or scarf to protect your head and keep it warm. It's also a good idea to dry off as quickly as possible once you're indoors or in warmer temperatures.
Of course, everyone is different and some people may be more susceptible than others to the effects of cold weather on wet hair. However, it generally seems to be safer to err on the side of caution when it comes to this type of situation. [end of text]
