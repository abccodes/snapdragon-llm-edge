 - A) You might get too excited. B) The TV picture might be better if it's closer. C) It could be bad for your eyes.
C) It could be bad for your eyes.
Explanation:
 Sitting close to a television can cause eye strain, headaches, and other vision problems because the distance between you and the screen is too short. Your eyes have to work harder to focus on something that's so close up, which can lead to discomfort over time. Additionally, sitting closer to a TV can also make it difficult for others in your household or room to see what you're watching.
The other options provided are incorrect:
A) You might get too excited: This is not related to the distance between you and the television and can occur regardless of how close or far away you sit from the screen. B) The TV picture might be better if it's closer: Sitting closer to a television may make the picture appear brighter and more detailed, but this does not necessarily mean that it will result in a better overall viewing experience. In fact, sitting too close can actually reduce the quality of the image by causing distortion or blurriness.
Therefore, the correct answer is C) It could be bad for your eyes. [end of text]
