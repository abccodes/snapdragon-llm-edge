 What is this type of question called?

This type of question is known as a astrology-related question. Astrology is the belief that celestial bodies, especially the stars and planets, influence people's lives or personalities.

The specific claim made in your example is an astrological assertion, which suggests that the position of the Sun at birth has some impact on someone’s personality. However, this kind of statement is not backed up by scientific evidence. Many professional astronomers and psychologists do not consider astrology to be a legitimate field of study due to its lack of empirical support.

It's important to critically evaluate claims about personal attributes or behavior based on astrological predictions. While there may be subjective interpretations or cultural significance associated with specific star positions, the impact on an individual’s personality cannot be substantiated scientifically. If someone is interested in exploring their own astrology-related beliefs or practices, it might help to separate these from any scientific conclusions and focus instead on personal interpretation and enjoyment of such pursuits.
