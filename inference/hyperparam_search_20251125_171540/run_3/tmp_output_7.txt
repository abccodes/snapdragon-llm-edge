If a penny was dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, it would fall and hit you with considerable force. The height of the building is about 1,450 feet (437 meters), so if you were standing directly beneath where the penny falls, it could potentially cause serious injury or even death due to the impact.

However, in practice, there are several factors that would likely mitigate this risk:

- **Time for Reaction**: By the time a penny reaches the ground from such a height, it would take around 30.7 seconds (ignoring air resistance). During this period, you could potentially move or jump out of harm's way.
  
- **Wind Resistance and Parachutes**: The Empire State Building is located in New York City, which has relatively high winds, especially during certain times of the year. These strong winds would slow down the penny significantly as it falls.

- **Impact Surface**: Even if you were directly beneath where the penny lands, the impact might be cushioned by an object below (like a roof or building structure) rather than hitting solid ground.

Overall, while theoretically very dangerous due to its speed and height, in practical terms, there would likely
