 Chameleon Color Changing

Chameleons are known for their ability to change color. This allows them to blend in with their surroundings and avoid predators. However, the exact reason why they can change colors is not completely understood.

One theory is that chameleons use their skin cells, called chromatophores, to change their color. Chromatophores contain pigments that reflect light at different wavelengths, giving the appearance of changing colors.
Another theory is that chameleons may be able to control their temperature by changing their color. Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors, so a chameleon with darker skin could potentially raise its body temperature when it needs to.

Regardless of how exactly they change color, it's clear that the ability to do so is an important survival skill for these fascinating animals. [end of text]
