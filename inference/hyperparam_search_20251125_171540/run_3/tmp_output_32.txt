 It's not just a question about geology, but also about environmental impact. As an AI language model, I can provide some information on what lies beneath the Denver International Airport and its potential effects.
Denver International Airport is located in the Denver metropolitan area of Colorado. The airport covers approximately 27 square miles (70 km²) of land and sits on top of a plateau at about 5,184 feet (1,590 m) above sea level. Beneath the airport's surface are various layers of soil and rock.
The primary layer beneath the airport is known as the glacial till. This layer consists of unsorted sediments that were transported by glaciers during the last ice age. Below this layer, there is a layer called bedrock, which includes granite and other types of igneous rocks.
There have been some concerns about potential environmental impacts associated with the construction and operation of Denver International Airport. For example, the airport's expansion has led to increased traffic and air pollution in surrounding areas. In addition, the extraction of sand for runway maintenance can impact local ecosystems and water supplies.
Overall, it is important to consider the long-term effects of infrastructure development on both human populations and natural environments. While there may
