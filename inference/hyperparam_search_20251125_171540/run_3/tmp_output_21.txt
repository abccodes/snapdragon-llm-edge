 
'the queen's speech is not recorded. The earliest version of the spoken dialogue, which was written by Walt Disney as part of his script for 1950 remake of Snow White, states that the Queen says to her mirror "Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?" but this was changed in the final version for technical reasons. In 1987, a new version of the film was made using computer graphics and there was no spoken dialogue at all.'
