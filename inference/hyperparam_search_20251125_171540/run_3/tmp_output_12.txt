 - The song "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is a popular nursery rhyme that has been in circulation for many years. While there is no definitive answer to who composed it, there are several theories.

One theory suggests that the lyrics were written by Sarah Josepha Buell Hays in 1806 as part of her book "Children's Rhymes and Games." However, this is not widely accepted because there is no evidence to support this claim. Another theory credits American author Jane Taylor with writing the song in 1805.

Despite these theories, it is important to note that the exact origins of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" are unknown, and it has been adapted by many composers over time. There have also been various versions of the lyrics and music throughout history. However, one thing that remains constant is its popularity among children around the world.

Overall, while there may be some uncertainty surrounding who composed "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," its enduring appeal as a beloved nursery rhyme continues to captivate generations of people. [end of text]
