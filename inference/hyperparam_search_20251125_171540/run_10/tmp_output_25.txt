 is a common question that many people ask. The answer to this question is Marie Antoinette, who was a French queen during the late 18th century. However, it's important to note that there is no evidence to support the claim that Marie Antoinette actually said this quote. The quote was likely created as a political statement against the French monarchy and was used to criticize the perceived excesses of the royal family. Marie Antoinette was executed during the French Revolution in 1793, and the quote has since become a symbol of the monarchy's perceived excesses and the failures of the French government.
