 is a question that many people have asked. The answer is not always clear, as the spiciness of a chili pepper can vary depending on the variety and the method of preparation.
The spiciest part of a chili pepper is often considered to be the seeds and the white membranes that surround them. These parts contain the highest concentration of capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their heat.
However, it's important to note that the spiciness of a chili pepper can vary depending on the variety and the method of preparation. For example, some chili peppers have thinner seeds and membranes, which can make them less spicy than others.
Additionally, the spiciness of a chili pepper can also be affected by factors such as the age of the chili pepper and the environment in which it was grown. For example, chili peppers that are harvested when they are fully ripe tend to be less spicy than those that are harvested when they are still green.
Overall, while the seeds and white membranes of a chili pepper are often considered to be the spiciest parts, the spiciness of a chili pepper can vary depending on a variety of factors. [end of text]
