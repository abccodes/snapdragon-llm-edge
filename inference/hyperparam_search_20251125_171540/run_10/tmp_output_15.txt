However, some people believe that MSG can cause harm to the human body, especially in small doses. There have been many studies on MSG, but the results are not entirely consistent. Some studies have found that MSG can cause symptoms such as headache, flushing, and nausea in some people, while other studies have found no significant effects. In general, the scientific community does not have a clear consensus on whether MSG is harmful to humans in small doses. However, it is generally recommended that people with sensitive digestive systems or those who have experienced adverse reactions to MSG should avoid consuming it. [end of text]
