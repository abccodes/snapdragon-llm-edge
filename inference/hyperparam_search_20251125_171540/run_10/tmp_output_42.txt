 is a common question that many people have. The answer to this question is that if you smash a mirror, it is considered to be bad luck. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this belief. In reality, breaking a mirror can cause injury and damage to property, but it does not bring bad luck. The superstition that breaking a mirror brings bad luck is a cultural belief that has been passed down through generations. It is important to remember that superstitions are not based in fact and should not be taken as a serious belief. It is better to focus on the practical consequences of breaking a mirror, such as the potential for injury and damage to property, rather than worrying about the supposed bad luck that may follow.
