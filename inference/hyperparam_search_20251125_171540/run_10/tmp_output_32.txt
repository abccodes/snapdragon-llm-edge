 is a question that many people have asked. The answer is that there is a large underground parking garage underneath the Denver International Airport.
The underground parking garage is one of the largest in the world, with a capacity of over 30,000 vehicles. It is located beneath the airport's main terminal and is connected to the airport's surface through a series of tunnels and walkways.
The underground parking garage was built in the 1970s and has been expanded and updated over the years to meet the growing demand for parking at the airport. It is an important part of the airport's infrastructure, providing a convenient and efficient way for travelers to park their vehicles while they are at the airport.
In addition to the parking garage, there are also several other underground facilities located beneath the Denver International Airport, including a baggage handling facility, a fueling station, and a utility room. These facilities are essential for the operation of the airport and help to ensure that it runs smoothly and efficiently. [end of text]
