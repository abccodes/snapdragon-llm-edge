 is a question that can be answered using the following Python code:

```python
country = 'United States'
print(country)
```

This code sets the variable `country` to the string 'United States', and then prints the value of `country` to the console. The answer to the question "In what country was Barack Obama born?" is therefore 'United States'. [end of text]
