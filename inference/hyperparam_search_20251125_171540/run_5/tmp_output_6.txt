Another factor that contributes to our understanding of how much of the brain we use is the concept of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of the brain to change and adapt over time, and it plays a crucial role in learning and memory. This means that different parts of the brain can be activated and used for various functions, depending on our experiences and activities.
