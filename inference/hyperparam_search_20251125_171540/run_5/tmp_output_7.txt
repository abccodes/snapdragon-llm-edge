 This question is often asked to test one's knowledge of physics and their ability to reason logically. The answer, however, may surprise some people.
The Empire State Building stands at 1,454 feet (442 meters) tall, making it one of the tallest buildings in the world. If a penny were dropped from the top of the building, it would fall for approximately 8 seconds before hitting the ground. During this time, the penny would accelerate due to gravity, reaching a speed of around 60 miles per hour (97 kilometers per hour) before impact.
While the penny may seem small and insignificant, its mass and momentum could still cause significant damage upon impact. The force of the impact would depend on the angle at which the penny falls and the surface it hits, but it is estimated that the penny could generate a force of up to 1,000 pounds (4,500 newtons) upon impact.
However, it is important to note that the likelihood of being struck by a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is extremely low. The building's height and the fact that pennies are often lost or discarded on the ground make it highly improbable for a penny to fall from such a
