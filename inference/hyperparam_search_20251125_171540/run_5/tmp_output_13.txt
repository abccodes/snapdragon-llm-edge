 asks a curious child. To answer this question, we need to understand the biology and anatomy of earthworms.
Earthworms are segmented worms that belong to the phylum Annelida. They have a soft body with no limbs or eyes, and they breathe through their skin. Earthworms have a digestive system that includes a mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines. They also have a circulatory system that consists of a network of blood vessels.
When an earthworm is cut in half, the front part of the worm will continue to live for a short period of time. The front part of the worm contains the head, which includes the mouth, esophagus, and brain. These organs are responsible for feeding and sensing the environment. The front part of the worm also has a network of blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the body.

These organs are responsible for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. The back part of the worm also has a network of blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the body.
