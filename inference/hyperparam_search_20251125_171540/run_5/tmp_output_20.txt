 asks a teacher. 'Because it might make your eyes hurt,' she explains.
A child sitting close to the TV is indeed at risk of eye strain and other vision problems, especially if they are watching for long periods of time. The closer someone sits to a screen, the more intense the light from the screen becomes, which can cause eye strain and headaches. Additionally, the blue light emitted by screens can disrupt sleep patterns and affect overall eye health.
To reduce the risk of eye strain and other vision problems when sitting close to a TV, it's important to maintain a proper viewing distance. The recommended distance for watching TV is about 2-3 times the diagonal length of the screen. For example, if you have a 40-inch TV, the recommended viewing distance would be between 8-12 feet.
In addition to maintaining a proper viewing distance, it's also important to take regular breaks and give your eyes a rest when watching TV for extended periods of time. The 20/20/20 rule is a good way to do this: every 20 minutes, look away from the screen and focus on an object that is at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.
