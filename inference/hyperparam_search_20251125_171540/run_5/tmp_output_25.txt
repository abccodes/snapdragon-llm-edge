 is a common question that many people ask. The answer to this question is Marie Antoinette.
Marie Antoinette was the Queen of France from 1774 until her execution in 1793 during the French Revolution. She was known for her extravagant lifestyle and her role in the political events of the time.
The quote "Let them eat cake" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence to support this claim. The quote is actually believed to have been said by a different person, possibly a member of the French aristocracy or a government official.
Despite the lack of evidence, the quote has become synonymous with Marie Antoinette and is often used to criticize her perceived lack of concern for the poor and her extravagant lifestyle during the time of the French Revolution. [end of text]
