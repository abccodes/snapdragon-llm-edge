 is a question that can be answered by looking up information about the organization's activities for that year. CERN, or the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is a major international research organization based in Switzerland that conducts experiments and research in the field of particle physics.
In 2012, CERN conducted several important experiments and research projects. One of the most notable was the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is one of the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerators. The LHC was used to collide protons at extremely high speeds in order to study subatomic particles and their interactions.
In addition to the LHC, CERN also conducted research on other topics such as dark matter, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. The organization also played a key role in the development of new technologies and techniques for particle physics research.
Overall, in 2012 CERN continued its important work in advancing our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe through cutting-edge research and experimentation. [end of text]
