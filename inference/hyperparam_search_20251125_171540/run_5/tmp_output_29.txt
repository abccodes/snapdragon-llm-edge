 I'm looking for the source of this quote. Can you help me find it?
attributed to Albert Einstein, but there is no evidence to support this claim. The quote "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results" is often attributed to Albert Einstein, but there is no evidence to support this claim. It is likely that the quote was coined by someone else and has been incorrectly attributed to Einstein over time. [end of text]
