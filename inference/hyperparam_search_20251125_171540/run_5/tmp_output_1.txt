 is a question that many people have. Fortune cookies are often associated with Chinese cuisine, but their actual origin is not as straightforward as it seems.
The first recorded use of fortune cookies in the United States was in 1907, when they were introduced to San Francisco by Japanese immigrants. However, the idea of putting fortunes in cookies had been around for centuries in China, where they were often given as gifts during weddings and other special occasions.
So while fortune cookies may have originated in China, it was the Japanese who brought them to America and popularized them. Today, fortune cookies are a beloved part of Chinese-American cuisine and are often served at Chinese restaurants and events around the world. [end of text]
