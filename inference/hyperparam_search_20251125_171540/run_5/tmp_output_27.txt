 Neil Armstrong famously said "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" when he stepped off the lunar module Eagle onto the surface of the Moon on July 20, 1969. However, the exact wording of his famous quote is often misquoted or incorrectly reported.
The full quote as it was recorded by NASA's Lunar Module Audio System was: "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." The words "a man" were added later to correct Armstrong's initial mistake of saying "for man."
Armstrong's famous quote has become an iconic symbol of the Apollo 11 mission and the United States' space program. It has been reproduced countless times in books, movies, and other media, cementing its place in popular culture.
It is worth noting that Armstrong's words were not the first to be spoken on the Moon. The Soviet Union's Luna 2 probe had already crashed onto the lunar surface in 1959, but it did not have a human aboard to speak. The first human to speak on the Moon was Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who orbited the Earth in 1961. [end of text]
