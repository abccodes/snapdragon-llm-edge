 is a question that has been asked by many people. The answer to this question is that Walt Disney's body was never found after his death in 1966.
Walt Disney died on December 21, 1966, at the age of 56. He had been suffering from lung cancer for several years and had been undergoing treatment for it. On the day of his death, he was taken to a hospital in Burbank, California, where he passed away.
After his death, Disney's body was transported to a morgue in Los Angeles, California, where it remained for several days before being transferred to a private funeral home. The funeral home then arranged for Disney's body to be transported to his hometown of Chicago, Illinois, where he was buried at Forest Home Cemetery on December 28, 1966.
Despite the fact that Disney's body was never found after his death, there have been many rumors and conspiracy theories surrounding his disappearance. Some people believe that Disney's body was taken by aliens or that it was moved to a secret location for some unknown reason. However, none of these theories have been proven true, and Disney's body remains buried in Forest Home Cemetery in Chicago
