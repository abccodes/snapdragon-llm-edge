 is a question that can be answered using the following Python code:

```python
def answer_country_of_birth():
    # Define the country where Barack Obama was born
    birth_country = "United States"
    
    return birth_country

# Call the function and print the result
print(answer_country_of_birth())
```

When you run this code, it will output: `United States`. This is because Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, which is part of the United States. [end of text]
