 is a common question that has been debated for many years. The answer is not straightforward, as it depends on how you define "use" and what you consider to be "typical."
One popular theory is that humans only use about 10% of their brains. This idea was popularized by the book "In Search of Schrödinger's Cat" by physicist Richard Feynman in the 1970s, but it has since been debunked by neuroscientists.
The human brain is a complex organ with billions of neurons and trillions of connections between them. While some areas of the brain are more active than others at any given time, it is unlikely that any single area of the brain is completely inactive for long periods of time.
In fact, most of the brain is constantly active, even when we are not engaged in any particular task. This constant activity helps to maintain the brain's function and keep it healthy.
So, while it may be tempting to believe that humans only use a small percentage of their brains, the reality is that the entire brain is involved in many different functions at all times. It is unlikely that any single area of the brain is completely inactive for long periods of time. [end of text]
