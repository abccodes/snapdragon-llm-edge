 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question can vary depending on the type of chili pepper and personal preference.
In general, the hottest part of a chili pepper is the inner flesh, which contains the seeds and membranes. This area is often referred to as the "pith" or "core" of the pepper. However, some varieties of chili peppers have a thinner pith or no pith at all, making them less spicy.
The heat in chili peppers is caused by a compound called capsaicin, which is found in the inner flesh and seeds of the pepper. The amount of capsaicin in a chili pepper can vary widely, with some varieties being much hotter than others.
Some people prefer to remove the pith or seeds from their chili peppers before eating them, while others enjoy the added heat and flavor. Ultimately, the spiciest part of a chili pepper is subjective and depends on personal taste preferences. [end of text]
