 is a question that can be answered by looking up information about the organization's activities from that year. CERN, which stands for European Organization for Nuclear Research, is known for its work in particle physics research and the development of the World Wide Web.

To answer this question, we need to look up information about CERN's activities in 2012. One way to do this is to search for news articles or reports from that year that mention CERN's activities. We can also look at CERN's official website or press releases to find information about their work.

Based on the information available, we can say that CERN did several things in 2012. One of the most significant events was the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson particle, which is a subatomic particle that is thought to give other particles mass. This discovery was made using data collected by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is one of CERN's main research facilities.

In addition to this major discovery, CERN also continued its work on developing new technologies and improving the efficiency of their research facilities. They also worked on various projects related to particle physics research, including studying the behavior of subatomic particles and exploring the
