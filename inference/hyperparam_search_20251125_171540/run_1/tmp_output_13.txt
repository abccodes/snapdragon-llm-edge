 asks a curious child. To answer this question, we need to understand the biology and anatomy of earthworms.
Earthworms are segmented worms that live in soil and are known for their ability to aerate the soil. They have a soft, cylindrical body with a head and tail, and they move by contracting muscles in their bodies.
If an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will not survive. The reason for this is that earthworms do not have a centralized nervous system or brain. Instead, they have a diffuse nervous system that runs along the length of their body. This means that each segment of the worm has its own set of nerve cells and can respond to stimuli independently.
When an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will still be able to move and contract muscles. However, because they do not have a centralized nervous system, they will not be able to coordinate their movements or communicate with each other. As a result, the two halves of the worm will eventually die from lack of oxygen and nutrients.
In summary, if an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will not survive because they do not have a centralized nervous system and cannot coordinate their movements or communicate with each other. [end of text]
