 It's an odd question to ask, but one that has puzzled people for many years. Despite being the most famous person in America when he died in 1966, the location of his grave remains unknown. Now, a new theory claims to have solved this mystery.
According to reports, Disney was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California on June 20, 1967, and is buried there in an unmarked grave. However, many people believe that the park's owners have removed his body or reburied it somewhere else for some reason.
One theory suggests that Disney was not actually laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park after all. Instead, he was secretly moved to a location on private property where his remains are now located.
Another explanation is that Disney's grave has been disturbed by vandals over the years and its contents have been stolen or destroyed. Some people even claim that Disney's body was taken out of the ground during construction at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.
Despite these theories, there is no concrete evidence to support any of them. The location of Walt Disney's remains still remains a mystery, with many people continuing to speculate about what happened to his body after he died
