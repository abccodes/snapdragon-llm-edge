 This is an important question that many people have. The's no one-size-fits-all answer, but there are some guidelines to keep in mind.
First and foremost, if someone is truly missing, it is best to contact the police as soon as possible after realizing they are gone. Waiting too long can lead to valuable evidence being destroyed or lost, making it more difficult for law enforcement to find the person and bring them home safely.
That said, there's no hard-and-fast rule about how many hours you should wait before filing a missing persons report. Some people may feel comfortable waiting a day or two if they don't have strong reason to believe that their loved one is in immediate danger. Others might want to act quickly out of concern for the person's safety.
Ultimately, it comes down to your own sense of urgency and how you know best what to do given the circumstances. If you're still unsure about whether to file a report or not, it may be helpful to speak with local law enforcement or seek advice from a trusted friend or family member who can provide guidance based on their experience.
In any case, erring on the side of caution and getting help as soon as possible is always the best approach when dealing with missing persons cases.
