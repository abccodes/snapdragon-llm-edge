 I have read that this is because of the way light reflects from the blood inside the vein. But, why don't we see red veins?

Well, you may think that it’s due to the fact that our skin and flesh absorbs most of the red light. However, it's actually because the arteries carry oxygenated blood, so they appear red.

The same principle applies to veins. They contain deoxygenated blood, which appears blue when reflected off the tissue underneath it. So why don't we see blue veins?

Well, there is one other reason for this phenomenon and that’s the way light travels through our skin. Our skin has many layers and it's not a uniform thickness. It also contains melanin pigments, which can absorb certain wavelengths of light.

As a result, when light enters our skin, some of it gets absorbed by these tissues and does not reach our veins. This means that we don't see blue veins because the amount of light reflecting off them is very low.
It’s important to note that while this explanation might seem plausible at first glance, there are actually several factors that contribute to why we can’t easily identify blue veins in our skin. The reason for this may not be fully understood yet.

So
