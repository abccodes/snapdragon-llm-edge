 - This question has been asked by many people and the answer might surprise you.
If you open an umbrella indoors, it is unlikely that anything will happen as long as there is no rain or other liquid present. An umbrella is designed to keep water out of your clothes when it rains, so if there is no water inside the umbrella itself, it should not cause any problems in an indoor setting.
However, it's important to note that some umbrellas may have small openings or vents on them to allow air and moisture to escape when they're open. If you are opening a new umbrella indoors, make sure that these openings are not blocked by anything that could prevent the air from escaping.
Overall, as long as there is no rain or other liquid present, opening an umbrella indoors should be safe and cause no problems. [end of text]
