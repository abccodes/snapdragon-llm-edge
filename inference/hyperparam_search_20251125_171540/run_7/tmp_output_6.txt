 This is a question that has been debated for decades, with various studies offering different answers. Some researchers claim that humans only use about 10% of their brains, while others argue that this figure is an exaggeration.
The reality is likely somewhere in between these two extremes. It's true that most people don't use all parts of the brain at once, but it would be a mistake to believe that we're only using a small percentage of our capacity.
Studies have shown that different regions of the brain are activated for various tasks and activities, including reading, writing, speaking, listening, thinking, feeling emotions, remembering things, solving problems, making decisions, creating art, playing sports, etc. These processes require coordination between different parts of the brain, which means that even when we're not actively engaged in a particular task, some areas of our brains are still active.
Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that humans have the potential to use all parts of their brains more fully if they choose to do so. For example, people who engage in activities such as learning new languages or playing musical instruments often show increased activity in certain regions of the brain associated with language and music processing.
