 asked the moderator. The audience was eager for an answer and several people guessed that Nixon might have been alluding to his involvement with Watergate.
Nixon's reply: "I am not a crooked politician."
The moderator then inquired if there were any other questions about the topic, but the audience remained curious. One of them suggested another possible interpretation - could Nixon be referring to his personal morality and integrity?
Nixon replied that he had always maintained high standards for himself and would never do anything to compromise those principles.
At this point, one member of the audience asked a question regarding the consequences of Nixon's resignation from office.
The moderator then shifted the topic back to the Watergate scandal. One person inquired about how the government could prevent such scandals from happening again in the future.
Nixon replied that he believed it was important for there to be strong oversight and accountability mechanisms in place, as well as an independent judiciary to hold those in power accountable.
The moderator then asked if anyone had any other questions on the subject. However, there were no further comments from the audience. The session ended with a brief thank you message from the moderator to all participants. [end of text]
