 I'm trying to understand the history and cultural significance of these little bits of wisdom that often come with Chinese-American meals. To answer this question, we need a step-by-step breakdown.
Sure! Fortune cookies originated in China during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). The first fortune cookie was said to have been created by a Chinese immigrant named Moon Mo who lived in San Francisco, California in 1885. At that time, Chinese immigrants were not allowed to bring their families with them and had to work long hours in factories. They often did not receive meals during the day, so they would make cookies for themselves during their breaks.
The fortune cookie became popular among Chinese-American communities as a way of sharing good wishes and blessings on special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, and holidays. The messages written inside the cookies were often positive or inspirational, with phrases like "May your life be filled with happiness" or "Good luck in all you do."
Today, fortune cookies are widely associated with Chinese-American culture and cuisine, but they can also be found in other cultures around the world. Some people even make their own homemade fortune cookie recipes to give as gifts or keep on hand for special occasions. [end of text]
