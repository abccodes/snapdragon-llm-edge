 I'm curious about the specific events or discoveries made that year.
Collider, or LHC) was operational for most of the year, and it's where all the exciting physics happens. The particle accelerator is used to collide protons at very high energies, creating new particles in the process. This allows researchers to study fundamental forces of nature and explore phenomena on scales too small to see directly.
In 2012, CERN made several significant discoveries that were announced during a press conference held by European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). One of these was the discovery of the Higgs boson particle. This elementary subatomic particle is thought to give other particles their mass and has been elusive for decades. The confirmation of its existence was a major breakthrough in physics.
In addition, CERN researchers also made progress with the development of new technologies used at the LHC. They improved the efficiency of data collection and analysis, which will help them make even more discoveries in future years.
Overall, 2012 marked an exciting year for particle physics research at CERN, as it saw significant advancements in our understanding of fundamental forces and subatomic particles. [end of text]
