 This is a very common question. Many people have seen this phenomenon in various places. In fact, the reason why chameleons can change their colors is related to temperature and their surroundings.

Firstly, chameleon skin contains special cells called chromatophores. These cells are responsible for changing color when stimulated by external factors such as changes in temperature or light exposure.
Secondly, the intensity of chromophore absorption depends on its pigmentation level. When exposed to bright sunlight, the pigment will be more prominent and result in a brighter color. Conversely, under low-light conditions, the pigment may appear less vibrant and result in a darker shade.
Thirdly, chameleons also have reflective structures called iridophores embedded within their skin. These reflectors can change the way light is scattered and absorbed by changing the angle of reflection. This allows them to alter their coloration even further based on environmental conditions.

Overall, these mechanisms help chameleons adapt to changes in temperature and surroundings by altering their appearance accordingly. Chameleon colors are often used for communication with other animals or as a means of camouflage.
This explanation is quite simple and does not fully capture the complexity behind why chameleons change colors. However, it can
