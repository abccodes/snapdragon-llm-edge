 asked a child.
I replied, "If you were to split it down the middle and leave each piece intact, they would regrow their body. If not, each half will die because it lacks vital organs."
A child might ask: "Does that mean there are parts of an earthworm's body without nerves?"
As an expert on zoology, I know very well that every part of an animal has a nerve ending, so there isn't such thing as "a part of the worm without nerves." But sometimes even experts can be wrong.
I said to the child: "Actually, the answer is different. We've all learned from textbooks and videos that earthworms lack nervous systems. When you cut them in half, each piece will die because it lacks a brain or spinal cord."
The child was very confused, so I said: "OK, let's think about this logically. If we can't see the brain or any other parts of their body when they are alive, why should we believe what textbooks and videos say?"
As an expert on zoology, I know that my answer is right, but even experts sometimes get carried away with knowledge. Therefore, there might be times when people's judgments cannot be trusted.
