 asks a young boy in the story. The boy's curiosity and innocence inspire him to learn about the world around him, including what he sees at bullfighting events. When he learns that a red cape is used by the matador during a performance, he wonders why it is not blue or green. Why would anyone choose red?
To explain this question we can use some basic principles of physics and biology.
Red color appears to us because there are special pigments in our eyes called cones that detect light waves with long wavelengths, such as red. These cone cells send signals to the brain where they are interpreted as the color red. In other words, humans see things differently depending on what colors are present in an object or environment.
Another reason why red is often used in bullfighting is because it can be easily seen against a white background, which allows the matador to control and guide his movements during the performance. The bright red cape also serves as a symbol of bravery and excitement for both spectators and participants.
Overall, there are many reasons why red is chosen over other colors such as blue or green in bullfighting performances, but it ultimately comes down to what our eyes can see and interpret as we move through the world around us.
