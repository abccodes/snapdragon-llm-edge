 - The song "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is a popular nursery rhyme that has been in circulation for centuries. There are various theories about its authorship, but no definitive proof has ever been found. One theory suggests that it was written by an unknown English schoolmaster named Robert Louis Stevenson, while another theory attributes it to an anonymous American poet from the early 19th century. However, most experts agree that the tune is not associated with any specific author and is likely a traditional folk song that has evolved over time. The lyrics "Twinkle, twinkle, little star" were written in German by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi in 1806 and first appeared in English in 19th century nursery rhymes collections. The tune of the song was independently composed several times throughout history and is now considered to be a part of the public domain. [end of text]
