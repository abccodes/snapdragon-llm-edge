The story is recounted in Genesis chapters 2-3, where it is told that God placed this tree at the center of the garden with two other trees: the Tree of Life to the east and the Tree of the Forbidden Fruit to the west.

The forbidden fruit was considered dangerous or deadly because its consumption would cause humans to die. However, Eve was tempted by a serpent to eat from the tree of knowledge and then convinced Adam to do so as well. As a result of eating the fruit, they were cast out of the garden and received divine punishment, including having their bodies marred with hair, which is often interpreted as an analogy for shame or guilt.

Despite this tragic event, many Christians interpret it as a symbol of humanity's fall from grace and our need for redemption through faith in Jesus Christ. [end of text]
