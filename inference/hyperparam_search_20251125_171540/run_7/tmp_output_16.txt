 - I know the answer, but can't remember it. Could anyone help?

Certainly! When going outside in cold weather with wet hair, there's a risk of developing frostbite or hypothermia because your head and ears are exposed to very low temperatures. To prevent this:

1. **Dry Off**: Make sure you're completely dry before stepping out into the cold.
2. **Cover Up**: Protect your head and face from wind chill by wearing warm hats, scarves, and gloves.
3. **Stay Warm**: If possible, stay indoors until your hair is completely dried and it's safe to go outside.

These steps can help keep you safe in the chilly weather! [end of text]
