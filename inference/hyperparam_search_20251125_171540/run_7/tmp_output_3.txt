 It's usually thought that it's the seeds or the membranes. However, that may not be true.
The capsaicin in hot peppers is found primarily in small oil droplets inside the cells in the flesh of the fruit. The cells surrounding these oil droplets are called vacuoles and contain a protein which makes them extremely painful when irritated.
So it appears that the spiciest part of a chili pepper may be the membranes surrounding those oil droplet-containing vacuoles, rather than the seeds or membranes.
That's why you get burned by touching your lips after handling hot peppers. The irritating proteins in these cells are absorbed through mucous membranes in the eyes and mouth, causing pain when they come into contact with nerve endings. This is why it's important to wear gloves while handling chili peppers.
It's also worth noting that not all parts of a chili pepper are equally spicy, even those that contain oil droplets. For example, some varieties have very thin membranes around the oil droplet-containing cells which can be more painful than thicker ones.
So next time you're cutting up hot peppers and get burned by touching your lips or eyes, remember to thank nature for these potentially irritating yet delicious little gems! [end of text]
