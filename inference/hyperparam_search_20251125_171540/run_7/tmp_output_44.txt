 asks the reader.
A: Nothing, it's just superstition.
B: A bad omen and bad luck will follow.
C: It depends on the person's beliefs. Some might think of good fortune while others view it as an ill omen.
D: Black cats are considered sacred animals in some cultures and may bring blessings instead of harm.

The correct answer is C. According to the passage, 'A black cat crossing your path can be seen as a sign of good or bad luck depending on your beliefs,' so option C is correct. Option A states that nothing will happen because it's superstition, but this contradicts the information in the passage. Options B and D are also incorrect because they do not align with the passage.
The final answer is: C. [end of text]
