 asked an intrigued young boy. To answer this question, we need to know how far it falls and what speed it reaches before striking the ground.
Assuming that a penny is dropped from the exact height of 1023 feet (which is the approximate height of the Empire State Building), we can use the formula for falling objects:
d = (gt)^2 / 2
where d represents the distance fallen, g represents gravity (acceleration due to gravity), and t represents time.
Substituting in our values, we get:
d = ((32.1 ft/s)^2) * (0.5 * 60480 feet/hour)
This gives us a total of approximately 973 miles or 1,564 kilometers fallen from the Empire State Building.
Next, we need to determine how fast it would be moving before striking the ground. We can use the following formula:
v = (2gt) / √(8 * g)
where v represents velocity, t represents time, and g represents gravity (acceleration due to gravity).
Substituting in our values, we get:
v = (2*32.1 ft/s)^/√(8 *
