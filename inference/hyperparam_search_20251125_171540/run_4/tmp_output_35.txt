 CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is best known for its Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is used to collide protons in order to study the fundamental particles that make up matter and energy. In 2012, CERN's LHC achieved a new record in terms of the energy of the protons it collided, reaching 8 trillion electron volts (TeV). This was a significant milestone in the history of particle physics research, as it allowed scientists to probe the Higgs boson, a particle that was predicted to exist by the Standard Model of particle physics but had not yet been observed. In addition to its research activities, CERN also plays an important role in education and outreach, providing resources and opportunities for students and the public to learn about the latest developments in particle physics and other areas of science.
