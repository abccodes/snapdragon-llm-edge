 The tune of 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' was composed by the English composer John Frederick Noyes (1786-1861). It was first published in 1805 as part of a collection of children's songs called 'Songs for the Nursery'. The lyrics were written by the English poet Mary Ann Radcliffe (1780-1825). Radcliffe's lyrics were originally titled 'Twinkle, Twinkle, How I Wonder What You Are' and were first published in 1780 in a collection of nursery rhymes called 'The Nursery Rhymes of the Most Excellent Sir Isaac Newton'. Noyes's tune was later adapted and published in the United States in 1824, where it became popular as 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'. The song has since become a beloved nursery rhyme and is often sung by children around the world. [end of text]
