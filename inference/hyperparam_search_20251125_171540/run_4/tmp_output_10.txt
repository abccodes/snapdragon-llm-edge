 is a question that can be answered using the following Python code:

```python
import datetime

declaration_date = datetime.date(1776, 7, 4)
print(f"The Declaration of Independence was officially signed on {declaration_date}.")
```

The code uses the `datetime` module to create a date object for July 4, 1776, which is the date on which the Declaration of Independence was signed. The `datetime.date` function is used to create a date object, and the `print` function is used to output the date to the console. The output of the code will be:

```
The Declaration of Independence was officially signed on 1776-07-04.
``` [end of text]
