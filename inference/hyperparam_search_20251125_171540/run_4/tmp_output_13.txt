 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question is that when an earthworm is cut in half, it will not survive. This is because earthworms do not have a brain or a nervous system that can control their movements. As a result, when an earthworm is cut in half, its two halves will continue to move independently of each other, but they will not be able to survive for long. The reason for this is that the two halves of the earthworm will no longer be able to obtain food and water, and they will eventually die. In addition, the two halves of the earthworm will also be unable to reproduce, as they will not be able to find a mate. Overall, when an earthworm is cut in half, it will not survive for long due to the lack of a nervous system and the inability to obtain food and water. [end of text]
