 is an interesting question that has been debated for many years. The answer to this question varies depending on who you ask and what research they have conducted.
One popular belief among scientists is that humans only use about 10% of their brains, but recent studies suggest otherwise. A study published in the journal Brain Research found that people are actually using more than half of their brain at any given time. The researchers used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure blood flow and activity levels throughout different parts of the brain.
The fMRIs showed that certain areas, such as those involved with language processing and memory formation, were active even when people weren't consciously thinking about them or doing anything specific. This suggests that these regions are constantly working in some capacity, rather than being idle most of the time.
Another study published by researchers at Harvard University found similar results using a different method called magnetoencephalography (MEG). The MEGs recorded brain activity as people performed various tasks and showed that certain areas were active even when they weren't engaged in any specific task. This suggests that these regions are constantly working to process information from the environment, rather than being idle most of the time.
Overall, it appears that
