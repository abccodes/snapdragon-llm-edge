This is because the Sun emits light across all parts of the visible spectrum, with different wavelengths appearing at various intensities. When observed from space, these wavelengths combine to create an overall appearance that we perceive as white. However, due to the way our eyes and brains process color, it can appear slightly yellow or orange when viewed directly from Earth's surface.
It is worth noting that the Sun does not have a constant temperature throughout its entire volume. The core of the Sun is extremely hot, with temperatures reaching up to 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), while the outer layers are much cooler, with temperatures ranging from about 6,000 degrees Celsius (10,832 degrees Fahrenheit) at the surface to around 4,000 degrees Celsius (7,232 degrees Fahrenheit) in space. These temperature differences can cause variations in color and brightness over time.
Overall, while the Sun appears white when viewed from Earth, its true appearance in space is a yellow-white or white-yellow due to the way it emits light across all parts of the visible
