 This question has been debated among food enthusiasts for years. While some believe it's the seeds, others argue that it’s actually the white membrane surrounding them.
To settle this debate once and for all, we need to conduct an experiment using different types of chilis peppers from around the world. We will measure their spiciness levels by conducting a taste test with volunteers who have varying degrees of spice tolerance.
In addition to measuring the overall heat level, we'll also analyze each chili pepper's chemical composition and identify any unique compounds that may contribute to its intensity. By comparing these results across different types of chilis peppers from various regions around the world, we can determine which part is truly spiciest.
So let’s get started on this exciting experiment! We're excited to see what discoveries await us in uncovering the true source of chili pepper heat. [end of text]
