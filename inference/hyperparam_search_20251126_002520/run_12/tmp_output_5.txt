 is a question that has been asked for centuries. The answer, however, may surprise you.
The reason why matadores use the traditional red cape in their performance at bullfighting is not because it attracts bulls or makes them angry. In fact, most modern-day professional bullfighters do not even wear red capes anymore!
Instead of using a red cape, many contemporary bullfights incorporate other types of clothing and props to create an exciting atmosphere for the audience.
The use of traditional red capes in bullfighting has its roots back centuries ago when bulls were more aggressive. The bright color was believed to make them angry or excited, which would increase their aggression towards the matador during a fight.
However, as time passed and techniques improved, it became clear that using colorful clothing did not have any significant impact on how aggressively bulls behaved in bullfights.
Today's professional bullfighters use other types of props such as swords, lances, and even horses to create an exciting atmosphere for the audience. The red cape is still used by some traditionalists but has largely been replaced with more modern techniques that are designed to keep both matador and crowd safe during a performance.
