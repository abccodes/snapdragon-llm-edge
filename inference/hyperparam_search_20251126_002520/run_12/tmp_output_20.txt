 asks a teacher. A student answers, "Because it's too bright." The following day in class, another student raises his hand and says, "I have an idea! We should put up posters around school that say 'Don't look at screens for more than 2 hours.'" What does this suggest about the students' understanding of why they shouldn't sit close to a television? 

A) They understand it is because there are too many advertisements.
B) They do not fully grasp the reason behind their own answer and need further explanation from the teacher or other sources.
C) The posters will solve all problems related to screen time for students in school.

D) Students have already learned about eye strain due to prolonged exposure to screens, but they lack knowledge on how long is too much. 

B) They do not fully grasp the reason behind their own answer and need further explanation from the teacher or other sources.
This suggests that while one student provided a plausible initial response based on his observation of brightness, another student's suggestion indicates an incomplete understanding of why sitting close to television can be harmful.

The second student proposed putting up posters around school with instructions about limiting screen time. This shows they are trying to address the issue but lack specific knowledge
