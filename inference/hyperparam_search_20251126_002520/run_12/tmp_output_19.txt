 is one question that many people ask. Apples have been around for thousands and thousands years, but their health benefits continue to be discovered every year.
Apples contain fiber which helps keep your digestive system healthy by moving food through it more quickly. Fiber also makes you feel full longer so you are less likely to overeat throughout the day. Eating an apple a day can help prevent constipation as well because of its high content in dietary fibers and water.
The antioxidants found in apples have been linked with reducing cancer risk, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson’s disease, cataracts and macular degeneration. Apples also contain vitamin C which is important for a healthy immune system as well as helping to prevent scurvy.
Apples are low in calories but high in nutrients so they make an excellent snack option between meals or before bedtime when you need something filling without adding too many extra calories to your daily intake. Eating apples can help with weight loss efforts because of their fiber content and the fact that it keeps you feeling full longer, which means fewer calorie-rich snacks later on.
Apples are also a great source for potassium, an important mineral needed by every cell in our body including muscles and nerves
