In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health organizations have repeatedly stated that there are no scientific studies proving MSG harmful to humans.

However, some people still believe that consuming large amounts of MSG may lead to symptoms such as headache or nausea. These reactions may be due to individual differences in sensitivity rather than a direct effect of the substance itself.
Therefore, it is recommended for individuals with sensitive stomachs and those who are prone to headaches not to consume too much MSG-rich foods.

In summary, there have been no scientific studies proving that consuming small amounts of MSG can cause harm. However, people should pay attention to their own body's reactions when eating food containing this flavor enhancer.
