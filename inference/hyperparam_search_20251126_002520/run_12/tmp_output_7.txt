 asks an online forum. The question is based on the popular urban legend that claims anyone who falls under such circumstances will be killed.
The answer to this query lies in understanding physics and probability, rather than superstition or myth. Let's break down what would happen if a penny were dropped from the top of the Empire State Building (ESB) – approximately 1350 feet high.

### Physics at Work

When an object falls freely under gravity without air resistance, it accelerates uniformly until reaching terminal velocity. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is about \(9.8 \text{ m/s}^2\).

#### Time of Fall
Firstly, we need to calculate how long the penny would take to fall from 1350 feet (approximately 416 meters). Using the formula for time under freefall:

\[ t = \frac{\sqrt{(h/g)}}{g/9.8} \]

Where:
- \( h \) is height in meters,
- \( g \approx 9.8 m/s^2 \).

Plugging in our values, we get:

\[
t ≈ \left(416 / (30 * sqrt{5})\right)^
