 is a question that can be answered using reasoning and knowledge about agriculture in different states of America.

To answer this, we need to consider which US State has the largest peach production area or yield per acre. Here are some key points:

1) Georgia: Often referred as "The Peach Capital," it's one of the leading producers.
2) California: While not traditionally known for peaches due to its climate being more suited towards citrus, they have become a significant producer in recent years thanks to advancements and new varieties that can withstand warmer temperatures.

3) New Jersey: Known primarily for apples but has been expanding into peach production as well. 

4) South Carolina: Also producing large quantities of peaches.
5) Arkansas: Not traditionally known for peaches, it's gaining popularity due to its favorable climate conditions.

Considering these points and the fact that Georgia is often mentioned first when discussing major producers (due to historical significance), we can conclude:

**Georgia produces more than any other state in terms of total peach production.**

Therefore, based on this reasoning and knowledge about agricultural practices across different states in America, **the answer to 'What U.S. State produces the most peaches?' is Georgia.** [end of text]
