 - The answer to this question can vary depending on who you ask. Some people may say that it's white, while others might claim that it appears yellow or orange.
However, there are actually several factors at play here:
1) Sunlight: When sunlight enters Earth’s atmosphere and reaches our eyes, the blue wavelengths scatter more easily than other colors due to Rayleigh scattering. This is why we perceive the sky as being predominantly blue during clear days on planet earth.
2) Atmospheric conditions: The color of the sun can also vary depending on atmospheric conditions such as cloud cover or dust particles in the air that may affect how sunlight reaches our eyes.
3) Time and location: Depending on when you observe it, the appearance of the Sun from space could be different. For example, during sunrise or sunset, the sky appears orange due to Rayleigh scattering and Mie Scattering (which occurs with smaller particulates in the atmosphere).
So while there is no definitive answer as to what color the sun looks like viewed from space, it can vary depending on a number of factors including sunlight, atmospheric conditions, time of day/night or location. [end of text]
