 is a question that many people have. Fortune cookie originated in China, and the earliest records of them date back to 1894 when they were first served at an American restaurant called Moon Lake Restaurant.
Fortune cookies are small baked goods filled with paper slips containing fortunes or messages written on them. They became popular as gifts for Chinese immigrants who came to America during that time period. Today, fortune cookies can be found in many restaurants and bakeries around the world, not just China.
The tradition of giving out fortune cookies at weddings is also very common in some parts of Asia, particularly among Japanese people. In Japan, it's customary to give a pair of small red envelopes containing money as well as a piece of paper with good wishes written on them when someone gets married.
Fortune cookie has become an important part of Chinese and Asian culture around the world today, representing luck, prosperity, and positive messages for those who receive one. [end of text]
