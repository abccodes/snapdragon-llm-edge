 is a common question that many people have. The answer to this question lies in the way light travels through our skin and how it interacts with blood vessels.
Veins are typically smaller than arteries, so they contain less red blood cells per unit volume of fluid compared to arteries. This means that when sunlight enters your body, some of it is absorbed by the tissue surrounding the veins and reflected back out into space as blue light.
Additionally, our skin contains a pigment called melanin which absorbs certain wavelengths of light more than others. Melanin tends to absorb red light while reflecting other colors like green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, violet, indigo and blue.
As sunlight enters the body through your eyes, it is absorbed by various tissues including blood vessels in veins. The reflected color depends on how much each tissue absorbs or reflects different wavelengths of light. Since melanin tends to absorb red light more than other colors like green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, violet and indigo, blue light is the most likely wavelength that will be reflected back out into space.
Therefore, when you look at a vein through your skin, it appears as if it's filled with blue blood because of this interaction between sunlight entering your body, tissues
