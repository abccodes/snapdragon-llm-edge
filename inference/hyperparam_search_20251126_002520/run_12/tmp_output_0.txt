 is a question that many people have. Watermelons are one of the most popular fruits in summer, and they contain various nutrients such as vitamins A and C.
Watermelon seeds can also be eaten raw or roasted. However, some people may wonder what will happen after eating them.
Eating too much watermelon seed could cause digestive problems because it is high in fiber content. Fiber helps to keep the intestines healthy by promoting bowel movements and preventing constipation. But if you eat more than your body can handle at once, this might lead to bloatedness or gas formation.
In addition, eating a large amount of seeds may also increase cholesterol levels due to their saturated fat content. However, studies have shown that moderate consumption of watermelon seed is unlikely to cause significant health problems in most people.
Overall, while it's safe for the majority of individuals to eat some number of watermelons and its seeds without any adverse effects on your body, eating too much can lead to digestive issues or cholesterol levels. It’s always a good idea to consume foods in moderation as part of an overall healthy diet plan. [end of text]
