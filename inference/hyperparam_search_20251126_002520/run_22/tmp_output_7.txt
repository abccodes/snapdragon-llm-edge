 This question is often asked to test one's knowledge of physics and their ability to reason logically. The answer, however, may surprise some people.
If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, it would not be fatal. In fact, it would likely cause only minor injuries or even no injury at all. This is because the penny would not have enough kinetic energy to cause serious damage when it hits your body.
To understand why this is the case, we need to consider the physics involved. The Empire State Building stands at a height of 1,454 feet (442 meters). If you were standing on the ground and dropped a penny from that height, it would have a speed of around 60 miles per hour (97 kilometers per hour) when it hit the ground.
However, this speed is not enough to cause serious damage. The kinetic energy of the penny at impact is only about 2 joules. This is equivalent to the energy released by a small explosion or the force of a light tap on your skin.
To put this into perspective, consider that a person weighing 150 pounds (68 kilograms) would need to fall from a height of over
