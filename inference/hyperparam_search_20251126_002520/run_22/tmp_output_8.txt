 is a question that can be answered using reasoning and knowledge about agriculture in the United States. To answer this question, we need to consider the major peach-producing states in the country and compare their production figures.

The top three states for peach production in the United States are California, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), California produced over 1.3 billion pounds of peaches in 2020, followed by Georgia with around 475 million pounds and South Carolina with approximately 360 million pounds.

While these states are known for their peach production, it's worth noting that other states like New Jersey, Michigan, and New York also produce significant quantities of peaches. However, when considering the total production across all states, California remains the leader.

Therefore, based on the available data and knowledge about agriculture in the United States, the answer to the question "What U.S. state produces the most peaches?" is California. [end of text]
