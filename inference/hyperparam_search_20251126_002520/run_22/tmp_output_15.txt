However, some studies have suggested that MSG may cause some adverse effects on human health, such as headache, flushing, sweating, and nausea. These symptoms are often referred to as "Chinese restaurant syndrome." Some studies have also found that MSG may be harmful to human health in large doses, but there is no scientific evidence to prove that MSG is harmful to humans in small doses. Therefore, it is not advisable to consume MSG in large quantities or for a long time. [end of text]
