 asks a student.
To answer this question, we need to consider the interaction of wet hair, cold weather, and the environment. Let's break down the scenario step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Interaction

1. **Wet Hair**: Hair is a good conductor of heat. When it's wet, it can absorb more moisture from the air and stay wet longer.
2. **Cold Weather**: Cold air is dry and does not readily transfer heat to wet surfaces.
3. **Environment**: The is typically low humidity and dry air in cold weather, which further hampers the transfer of heat from the air to wet hair.

### Step 2: Heat Transfer

- **Heat Transfer from the Air to the Hair**: In cold weather, the air is typically not very humid, so it doesn't readily transfer heat to wet hair.
- **Heat Transfer from the Hair to the Air**: Wet hair is a good conductor of heat. As the hair cools down, it will transfer heat to the surrounding air.

### Step 3: Physical Effects

1. **Evaporation**: As the hair cools down, the water in the hair starts to evaporate. The evaporation process is endothermic, meaning
