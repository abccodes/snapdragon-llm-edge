 is a common question. The answer is that chameleons change colors for communication, and also to regulate their body temperature.
Chameleons have chromatophores, which are cells that can change the color of the skin by changing the size of the cells and the arrangement of the pigments. This allows the chameleon to change the color of its skin to match its surroundings or to communicate with other chameleons.
Chameleons use color change for communication. For example, a chameleon may change its color to warn another chameleon of danger or to signal that it is ready to mate. Chameleons also use color change to regulate their body temperature. They may change their color to absorb or reflect sunlight, depending on whether they want to warm up or cool down. This is especially important in their native habitats, where the temperature can fluctuate widely. [end of text]
