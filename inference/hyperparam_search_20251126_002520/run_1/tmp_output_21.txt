 

The Queen says to her mirror in the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" This is often considered one of the most famous lines in film history. The line is a reference to a nursery rhyme that was popular in England at the time. The Queen's mirror responds by saying, "You are the fairest of them all, my Queen." [end of text]
