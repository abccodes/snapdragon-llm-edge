 A penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building would not cause any harm to a person. The building is made of reinforced concrete and steel, and the penny would simply bounce off the surface without causing any injury. Additionally, the impact of the penny would be minimal due to its small size and weight. Therefore, it is safe to say that being struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building would not cause any harm to a person. [end of text]
