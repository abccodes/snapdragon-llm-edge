 - The Sun appears white when viewed from space. However, the Sun's surface is actually hotter than the temperature of the surrounding space. The reason for this is that the Sun radiates energy in all directions, including upwards. As a result, the temperature of the Sun's surface is much higher than the temperature of the surrounding space. The Sun's surface temperature is around 5,500 degrees Celsius, while the temperature of the surrounding space is around -455 degrees Celsius. Therefore, when viewed from space, the Sun appears white because the energy it radiates is evenly distributed in all directions. [end of text]
