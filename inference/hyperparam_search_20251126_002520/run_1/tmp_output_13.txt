 - This question is about biology. To answer this question, we need to understand the life cycle of an earthworm and how it is affected by its body structure.
Earthworms reproduce by laying eggs. The eggs hatch into wriggly worms that look like little earthworms. These worms grow and mature into adults, which are much longer and have a smoother skin.
An earthworm is made up of several segments, each with its own set of muscles. These muscles help the earthworm move by contracting and relaxing in a wave-like motion. When an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will continue to move independently for a short time. This is because each half has its own set of muscles and can contract and relax independently.
However, after a short time, the two halves will stop moving. This is because the earthworm's body is connected by a network of nerves and blood vessels. When an earthworm is cut in half, these connections are severed, and the two halves will no longer be able to communicate with each other. Without the ability to communicate, the two halves will eventually die.
In summary, if an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will continue to move independently for a short time.
