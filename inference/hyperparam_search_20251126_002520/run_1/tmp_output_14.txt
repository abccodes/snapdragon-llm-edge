 According to the Bible, Adam and Eve ate an apple from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden. However, it's important to note that the Bible does not describe the fruit as an apple, but rather as a tree with fruit that was prohibited for Adam and Eve to eat. The story of Adam and Eve is a central part of the Christian faith and is told in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament. [end of text]
