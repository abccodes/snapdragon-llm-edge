The body is designed to handle foreign objects, and in most cases, the gum will simply pass through the digestive system without causing any problems.
However, there are some instances where swallowing gum can be dangerous. For example, if someone has a medical condition that affects their ability to swallow properly, swallowing gum could potentially cause blockages or other complications. Additionally, if someone has a history of swallowing foreign objects, swallowing gum could potentially be harmful.
Overall, while swallowing gum is generally not harmful, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and to take appropriate precautions. If you have any concerns about swallowing gum, it is always a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional. [end of text]
