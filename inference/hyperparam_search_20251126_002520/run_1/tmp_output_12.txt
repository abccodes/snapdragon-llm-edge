 Answer: John Lennon. John Lennon was a member of the Beatles, one of the most famous English rock bands of all time. The Beatles were known for their innovative music and their many hit songs, including "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." Although John Lennon is often credited with composing the tune, it is actually believed that the tune was written by an anonymous author in the late 18th or early 19th century. The lyrics, which were written by an unknown author in the late 19th century, were then set to music by the American songwriter Josephine Langford in 1899. However, the Beatles' version of the song became one of the most popular and recognizable versions of the tune, and it is often credited with Lennon's name. [end of text]
