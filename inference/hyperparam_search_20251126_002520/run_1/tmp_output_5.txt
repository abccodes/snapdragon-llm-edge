 is a popular question. The answer is that the red capes are a distraction from the bull, allowing the matador to focus on the bull's vital organs. However, the reason for the red color is more complex. The red color of the cape is not just for distraction, but also for symbolic reasons. In many cultures, red is a color of strength, courage, and passion. For the matador, the red cape is a symbol of his own courage and passion for the sport. The red color also has a practical purpose. Bulls are attracted to the color red, so by wearing a red cape, the matador can draw the bull's attention to himself and away from the audience. In addition, the red color of the cape can help the matador see the bull more clearly, as it contrasts with the green grass and the blue sky. Overall, the red cape is an important part of the matador's attire and serves both practical and symbolic purposes. [end of text]
