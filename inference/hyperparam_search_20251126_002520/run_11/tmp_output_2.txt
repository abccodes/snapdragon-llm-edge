 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question lies in the way light interacts with blood and how our eyes perceive it.
Veins are typically visible on skin because they contain deoxygenated red blood cells, which absorb most of the wavelengths of white light except for green and some near-infrared (NIR) radiation. When sunlight passes through the air or other mediums such as water, blue-green light is scattered more than longer wavelength colors like yellow-orange-red.
As a result, when we look at veins on skin, they appear to be dark because most of the red blood cells are absorbing all wavelengths except for green and NIR which scatter less. The scattering effect causes some of this reflected light to reach our eyes as blue-green color, making it seem that veins are actually appearing blue.
It's worth noting that while we perceive veins as being blue due to their absorption properties, they can also appear red or dark depending on the angle at which you're looking and other factors such as skin tone. Additionally, some people may have different levels of pigmentation in their blood vessels, leading them to see veins differently than others.
Overall, understanding why veins appear blue requires an appreciation for how light interacts with our bodies and how we
