 Fortune cookies originated in China and were brought to the United States by Chinese immigrants. They have become popular as a dessert at Chinese restaurants and are often eaten on special occasions such as weddings and holidays. Today, they can be found in many different flavors and designs, including fruit-flavored varieties and those with traditional messages of good fortune written inside. Despite their popularity today, the exact origin of fortune cookies remains unclear and there is much debate among historians about where and when they first appeared. Some believe that they originated as a way to communicate good news or wishes to Chinese immigrants during difficult times, while others suggest that they were created as a form of entertainment for diners at Chinese restaurants. Whatever their origins may be, fortune cookies have become an important part of American culture and are loved by people all over the world. [end of text]
