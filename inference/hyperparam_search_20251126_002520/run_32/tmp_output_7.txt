 A question asked by one of my students. It's a fascinating thought experiment. If a penny was dropped from the very top of the Empire State Building (which stands at 1,450 feet), it would take approximately 36 seconds to hit the ground due to gravity.
The speed of the falling penny will increase as time goes on, and when it finally reaches the ground, it will have a velocity of around 72 miles per hour. At this point, the impact could be potentially dangerous for any person or object in its path.
It's worth noting that while a penny might seem insignificant compared to other objects, such as cars or buildings, falling from such a great height can cause significant damage due to the kinetic energy it possesses. Therefore, it is always important to exercise caution when dealing with high-rise buildings and their surroundings. [end of text]
