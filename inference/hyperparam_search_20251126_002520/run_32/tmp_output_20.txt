 A child might say, 'Because it's too bright.' If a person says that they don't like something because 'it's too loud,' is this explanation likely to be correct? Let's think about why this explanation could or could not be accurate.

   - In general terms, something that exceeds a certain level of intensity or volume can be considered "loud." However, this threshold varies depending on factors such as personal tolerance, surrounding noise levels, and the nature of the sound.
