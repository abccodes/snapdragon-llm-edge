 I'm sorry, but that's a trick question! The answer is always white.
The sun appears yellow or orange to us on Earth because of atmospheric scattering. But when we look at it directly from outer space, its true color is white.
This might seem counterintuitive, given the bright and colorful appearance of stars in photographs taken by astronauts. However, this has more to do with how our eyes perceive light than with the actual spectrum emitted by the sun.
So next time you're looking up at the sky, remember that no matter what the color seems to be, the sun is always white when viewed from space! [end of text]
