 Is this a valid question for a science fair project?
Yes, that would make a good science fair project. It's definitely something you could investigate using the scientific method to see what happens.
Here are some ideas on how to approach it:
- Hypothesis: What do you think will happen when an earthworm is cut in half? Write down your hypothesis before starting the experiment
- Materials: You'll need a live earthworm, scissors or something sharp to make cuts, and a container with soil or water to put the worms after cutting them.
- Procedure:
1. Carefully observe and record where you want to make the cut on the worm's body
2. Use your scissors or other tool to make a clean cut down the middle of the earthworm's body
3. Watch what happens to each half for several days, recording any changes you see in behavior, movement, etc.
4. After observing both halves for several days, compare them to see if there are differences between how they're doing and why.
- Conclusion: Based on your observations, did cutting the earthworm in half affect its ability to move or function? Was this what you expected?
There's a lot you could explore with this project - feel free to
