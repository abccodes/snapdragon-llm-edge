 - A popular question about bullfighting.
The answer is that the colour of a cape doesn't matter to bulls. Bulls are colorblind and they don't react in any way to the specific shade or hue of the cloth being used during a bullfight.
So why do matadores use red caps? The truth is there's no particular reason for it either - it just happens to be what most people think of when thinking about bullfighting. However, bulls are attracted by movement and not colour, so any fabric would work as long as it was moving in the correct way.
It's also worth noting that while red has traditionally been associated with blood and danger, there is no evidence that this actually makes bulls more aggressive or prone to attack. In fact, many people believe that a bullfighting cape is simply designed to look scarier and more menacing than other types of fabric in order to make the spectacle seem more exciting.
So while red may be associated with danger and excitement for some, there's no real reason why matadores need to use this specific shade of cloth when they're fighting bulls. In reality, any movement that catches a bull by surprise should work just as well! [end of text]
