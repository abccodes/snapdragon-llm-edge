 I asked.
"Nothing," he replied. "Watermelon seeds pass through our bodies and come out as poop."
I said, "But what about the enzymes in the seed that can cause digestive problems?"
He shrugged his shoulders. "We don't know anything about those enzymes because we never consume them. There are no studies on humans who eat watermelon seeds regularly."
"How about the vitamins and minerals?" I asked.
"Vitamins and minerals? Those things come out of the ground when you plant a seed, not from eating it." he replied.
I said, "But what if some people eat too many watermelon seeds?"
"They would have diarrhea," he responded. "Watermelon seeds contain lots of fiber."
"But some people may be allergic to them," I pointed out.
"No allergies? We don't know anything about that either because we never consume the seed." 
I laughed and said, "Well, if you're right, then there's nothing wrong with me eating watermelon seeds."
My friend looked at me puzzled. "Why not?"
"Well," I replied, "There are no studies on humans who eat them regularly, so how can anyone tell whether they will cause digestive problems or other negative effects?" 
My friend laughed
