 I asked.
A young man replied, "I get a chill. "
As an AI language model, my response would be:
"Going outside in cold weather with wet hair can indeed cause you to feel chilly or even develop hypothermia, especially if your body temperature drops below normal. Wet hair is more prone to absorbing heat from the air than dry hair, so it may take longer for your body to warm up after being exposed to cold temperatures.
To prevent this from happening, make sure to cover your head and keep your wet hair as dry as possible when going outside in cold weather. You can also wear a hat or scarf to help insulate your head and neck, which are areas that tend to lose heat quickly."
Is there anything else you would like me to add? [end of text]
