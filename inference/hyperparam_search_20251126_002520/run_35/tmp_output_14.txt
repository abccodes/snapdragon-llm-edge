 According to the story as told in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, Adam and Eve were tempted by a serpent and ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. This act caused them to be expelled from the garden by God. The fruit itself is not named specifically in the text. However, it has become culturally associated with temptation and sin.
