 My mother asks. I reply, 'Because it will make me fatter.' Is this a good answer?
 sitting too close to a TV can indeed lead to weight gain, but your answer is not very helpful or informative for someone who might be considering how far away from the TV they should sit.
A better response would be something like: "I shouldn't sit close to the television because it makes my eyes strain and I'm more likely to snack on unhealthy foods while watching. It's also important to give myself enough space so that I can move around comfortably during commercial breaks."
This answer provides specific reasons why sitting too close to a TV is not good for you, rather than just stating that it will make you fatter.
It also acknowledges the potential for overeating while watching TV and suggests ways to avoid this problem. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of giving yourself enough space so that you can move around comfortably during commercial breaks, which is another important consideration when sitting too close to a TV.
