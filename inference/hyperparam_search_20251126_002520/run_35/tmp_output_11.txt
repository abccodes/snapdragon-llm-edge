 is a question that has been asked by many people. The answer to this question may surprise you!
The sun appears white when viewed from space, but it actually emits light across the entire visible spectrum of colors.
When we look at the sun from Earth, it often appears yellow or orange because of atmospheric scattering and absorption of blue light. However, this is an illusion caused by our atmosphere and not a reflection of the true color of the sun itself.
The sun's surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit), which means that it emits all colors in the visible spectrum, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. However, these colors are not equally distributed across the solar disc.
The sun's surface is dominated by a layer called the photosphere, which appears as white or slightly yellowish due to its high temperature. The upper layers of the atmosphere, known as the chromosphere and corona, emit different colors depending on their temperatures and densities.
When viewed from space, astronauts have reported seeing the sun appear with an orange tinge due to atmospheric scattering and absorption of blue light. However, this is not a true reflection of the color of the
