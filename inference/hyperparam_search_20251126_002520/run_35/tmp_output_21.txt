 

The exact quote from the movie is "Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" However, it was changed slightly for the English version. The original German line was "Spiegel, Spiegel an der Wand, wer ist die schönste von ihnen allen?" which translates to "MIRROR, MIRROR ON THE WALL, WHO IS FAIRER THAN YOU ALL?" 

The Queen's question is a classic example of what we now call "mirror ball" or "magic mirror," a type of self-image object that reflects the user back. The phrase has since become part of popular culture and language.

So in conclusion, the exact words that the Queen says to her mirror are "Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" [end of text]
