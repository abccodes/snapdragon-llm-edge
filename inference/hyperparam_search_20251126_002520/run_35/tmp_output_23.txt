 Paul Revere famously rode through Massachusetts on April 18, 1775, warning colonists about the impending arrival of British troops. During his famous "midnight ride," he is said to have shouted out: "The regulars are coming out! The regulars are coming out!" This phrase became one of America's most recognizable patriotic slogans.
Revere was a silversmith and colonial minuteman, who lived in Boston. He had been hired by the Massachusetts Provincial Congress as an intelligence agent. Revere received word from Dr. Joseph Warren that British troops were advancing on Concord. As he rode through the countryside, warning colonists about the approaching redcoats, he shouted: "The regulars are coming out! The regulars are coming out!" to alert people in his path.
Revere's famous ride was a crucial event during the American Revolutionary War and helped spark the colonial resistance against British rule. His warnings allowed time for militiamen to gather and prepare for the impending battle, which ultimately led to the Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. This event is considered one of the first armed conflicts of the American Revolution.
