 A question asked in an interview. The answer given was that the person would probably be killed, as falling objects can cause severe injuries or death.

However, a different scenario was presented: What if instead of being struck directly by the penny, you were hit by it while walking on the sidewalk below the Empire State Building? In this case, many people believe that they would only receive minor injuries because the fall distance is much shorter than from the top of the building.
