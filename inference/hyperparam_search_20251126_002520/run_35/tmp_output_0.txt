 I asked. 

I was told that eating the seeds is fine as long as they're not swallowed whole, and that they contain no harmful substances.

I've also heard from some people who say that eating too many of them can cause stomach pain or indigestion because of their fibrous content.

So, what's your take on this? What do you think?

What are the benefits and risks associated with consuming watermelon seeds?
Watermelon seeds contain a variety of nutrients including protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Eating them may have some potential health benefits such as improving digestion, promoting heart health, supporting bone health, and potentially reducing inflammation.

However, there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims. Additionally, eating too many watermelon seeds can cause gastrointestinal discomfort due to their fibrous content, especially if they are swallowed whole without chewing properly.

Overall, it's generally safe for most people to consume small amounts of watermelon seeds as part of a balanced diet. However, individuals with certain medical conditions or sensitivities may want to consult with a healthcare professional before consuming them in large quantities. [end of text]
