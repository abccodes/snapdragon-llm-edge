If you were to cut an earthworm in half, the two halves would not be able to survive on their own. The head and tail of an earthworm are connected by a network of nerves that allows them to communicate with each other. When one half of an earthworm is cut off from the other, this communication network is severed, and the two halves will no longer be able to function together.
In addition, the body segments of an earthworm have specialized structures called clitellaria that help them reproduce by producing eggs. If one half of an earthworm is cut off from the other, these reproductive organs may also be damaged or destroyed, making it impossible for the two halves to produce offspring.
Overall, cutting an earthworm in half will result in both halves dying within a relatively short period of time due to loss of communication and specialized structures. [end of text]
