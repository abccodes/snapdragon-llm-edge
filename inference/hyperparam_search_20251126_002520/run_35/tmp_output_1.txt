 I'm asking because I've been curious about their history. Can you help me understand where they come from?
Certainly! Fortune cookies are a popular treat in American Chinese cuisine, but their origins are somewhat debated among scholars and historians.
One theory suggests that fortune cookies originated in Japan during the late 19th century as a way to package small fortunes or messages for customers who were leaving Japan. These fortunes were often written on slips of paper inside envelopes, which would then be placed in cookie wrappers before being given to customers.
Another theory is that fortune cookies were actually invented in America by Chinese immigrants around the turn of the 20th century. This version suggests that they were first created as a way for Chinese restaurants to offer customers small gifts or messages without having to go through the process of making paper envelopes and writing fortunes on them.
Regardless of their exact origins, fortune cookies have become an integral part of American Chinese cuisine and are often given as gifts during special occasions such as weddings or birthdays. They continue to be a popular treat for many people around the world today! [end of text]
