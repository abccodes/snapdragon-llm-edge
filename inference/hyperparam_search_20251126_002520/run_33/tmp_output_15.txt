MSG has been widely used in the food industry for many years, and its safety has been extensively studied. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that MSG is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). In China, the Ministry of Health has also determined that MSG is safe for human consumption. Many studies have also shown that MSG is generally safe for human consumption in small doses. However, some people may experience symptoms such as headache, nausea, and flushing after consuming MSG, which are usually considered to be temporary and mild. These symptoms are not considered to be harmful to human health. Therefore, MSG has not been scientifically proven to be harmful to humans in small doses. [end of text]
