 is a common question that has been debated for many years. The answer to this question is not straightforward, as it depends on how you define "use" and what you mean by "brain."
One popular theory is that humans only use a small percentage of their brain, and that the rest is "wasted." This theory is based on the observation that many people have brain injuries or conditions that affect only a small part of their brain, yet they are still able to function normally. However, this theory has been widely discredited by neuroscientists, who have shown that the brain is highly interconnected and that every part of it is involved in some way in the functioning of the body.
Another theory is that humans use all of their brain, but that we are only aware of a small part of it. This theory is based on the observation that the brain is capable of performing many different functions, and that we are only aware of a small subset of these functions. However, this theory has also been widely discredited by neuroscientists, who have shown that the brain is highly specialized and that each part of it is responsible for a specific function.
In conclusion, there is no clear answer to the question of what percentage of the brain humans typically
