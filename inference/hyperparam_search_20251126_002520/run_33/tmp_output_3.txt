 is a question that many people have asked. The answer is not always clear, as the spiciness of a chili pepper can vary depending on the variety and how it is prepared.
The spiciest part of a chili pepper is the inner flesh, also known as the endocarp. This is the part of the pepper that contains the seeds and is usually the hottest. However, the heat can also be found in the outer layers of the pepper, including the skin and the white membrane that separates the seeds.
It's important to note that the spiciness of a chili pepper can vary depending on the variety and how it is prepared. For example, some varieties of chili peppers are naturally hotter than others, and the heat can be intensified by removing the seeds and white membrane.
