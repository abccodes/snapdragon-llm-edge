 is a question that can be answered by a simple observation. The sun appears yellow when viewed from space. This is because the sun's light is composed of a spectrum of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. When these colors are combined, they form white light. However, when the sun's light passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered by the gas and dust particles in the atmosphere. This scattering causes the blue and green colors to be absorbed or scattered more than the other colors, resulting in the sun appearing yellow when viewed from space. [end of text]
