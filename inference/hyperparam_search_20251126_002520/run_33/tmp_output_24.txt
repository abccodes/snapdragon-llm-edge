 Nixon was referring to his own honesty and integrity. He was not implying that he was not capable of being dishonest or corrupt, but rather that he was not dishonest or corrupt at the time he made the statement. The statement was made during a televised address to the American people in 1974, following the Watergate scandal. Nixon was under investigation for his involvement in the cover-up of the Watergate break-in, and he was facing impeachment proceedings in Congress. In his address, Nixon denied any wrongdoing and stated that he was not a crook. The statement was seen as a bold and defiant response to the allegations against him, and it helped to maintain his popularity with the American people. However, it also contributed to the perception that Nixon was not being truthful about his involvement in the Watergate scandal, and it ultimately led to his resignation from the presidency in 1974.
