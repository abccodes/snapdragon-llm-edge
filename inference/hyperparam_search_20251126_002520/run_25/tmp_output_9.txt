 is a question that many people have asked. Chameleon color changes are an adaptation to their environment and can be used for communication, camouflage or temperature regulation.
Chamaleon skin contains special cells called chromatophores which contain pigments such as melanin (dark), carotenoids (orange/yellow) and phycobilins (blue). These pigment-containing structures allow the chameleon's color change by adjusting how much light is absorbed and reflected from their body. When a chameleons skin becomes warmer, it causes these chromatophores to expand which allows more pigments to be exposed on its surface causing an increase in brightness or intensity of colors.
Chamaleon can also use this ability for communication purposes as different color patterns may indicate aggression, submission and other emotions. They are able to change their body temperature by changing the amount of pigment they display. When a chameleon needs more warmth it will expand chromatophores which causes its skin to become darker in order absorb heat.
Chameleons can also use this ability for camouflage as some species have color patterns that match with certain backgrounds such as leaves, rocks or sand allowing them to blend into their surroundings and avoid predators. They are able to change the pattern of pigments
