 What would be the answer to this question?
: If an Earth worm were cut into two halves, each segment that remains alive will continue growing. This means that both segments can potentially regenerate their missing parts and become whole again.
This phenomenon occurs because of a unique feature called "apoptosis" which is present in earthworms. Apoptosis refers to the process by which cells die naturally as part of normal development or repair, but it also plays an important role in regeneration.

In addition to apoptosis, Earth worms have another remarkable ability that allows them to regenerate their missing parts - they can form new tissues from existing ones. This is known as "tissue plasticity" and helps the worm recover quickly after being cut into two halves.
Overall, if you were able to observe an earthworm that had been cut in half, both segments would continue growing until they became whole again through a combination of apoptosis, tissue regeneration and other biological processes. [end of text]
