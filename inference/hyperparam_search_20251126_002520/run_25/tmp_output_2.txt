 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question can be found in the way light interacts with blood and skin.
Veins are visible because they contain deoxygenated red blood, which absorbs most of the wavelengths of white light except for blue. When sunlight enters our eyes through the atmosphere, it passes through a layer called the stratosphere where ozone molecules absorb much UV radiation but allow some shorter wavelength (blue) to pass on.
As this short-wavelength light travels down into Earth's surface and reaches skin or other objects that are not reflective of these wavelengths, they scatter in all directions. This scattering is known as Rayleigh Scattering. The blue color we see when looking at the sky during a clear day is due to Rayleigh Scattering caused by molecules like nitrogen and oxygen.
When light enters our eyes through blood vessels such as veins or arteries, it can be absorbed or scattered depending on its wavelength. Red wavelengths are more likely to absorb into skin while shorter wavelengths (blue) tend to scatter in all directions. This scattering causes the blue color of venous blood to appear visible against a darker background.
It's important to note that the visibility and appearance of veins may vary based on factors such as age, gender
