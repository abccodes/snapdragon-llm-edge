 is a question that has been asked for centuries. The answer, however, may surprise you.
The reason why matadores use red capes in their performances is not because of any special significance to the color itself or its association with bloodshed and violence. Rather, it's simply due to practical reasons related to visibility on stage.
Red is a highly visible color that stands out against white backgrounds such as those found at bullrings. This makes it easier for spectators to see the movements and actions of matadors during their performances. Additionally, red capes are often made from materials with reflective properties, which further enhances their visual appeal.
In summary, while there may be some cultural or symbolic significance associated with using red in traditional Spanish culture, its primary purpose on stage is simply practical - making it easier for audiences to see and appreciate the skillful maneuvers of matadors during bullfighting performances.
