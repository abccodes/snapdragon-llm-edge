 asks a teacher. A student answers, "Because it's too bright." The correct answer is that sitting closer makes objects on TV appear larger and more detailed.
To explain this phenomenon in simple terms:
When an object is farther away from your eyes, its image appears smaller because light rays have further distance to travel through the air before reaching your eye. This means less detail can be seen clearly.

However, when you sit close enough to a television screen, it's as if objects on TV are closer than they actually are in real life. The brain interprets this and makes everything appear larger and more detailed because of how light rays travel through the air from the object (in this case, your eyes) back into the eye.

This is why sitting close to a television can make things look bigger or clearer on screen.
It's important for students to understand that while it may seem like objects are closer when you sit near them, they're actually farther away. This helps in understanding how light travels and affects our perception of distance and size. [end of text]
