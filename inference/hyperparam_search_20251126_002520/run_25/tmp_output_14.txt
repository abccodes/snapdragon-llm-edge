The story goes that Eve, tempted by a serpent who claimed it would make her wise and give her power over others, convinced Adam to eat the fruit from this forbidden tree. As punishment for their disobedience, God expelled them from Eden.

It's important to note that interpretations of these events vary among different religious traditions and denominations within Christianity. Some interpret the story as a literal account while others view it more symbolically or allegorically. [end of text]
