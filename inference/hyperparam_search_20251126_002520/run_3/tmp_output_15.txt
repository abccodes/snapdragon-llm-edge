 The answer is 'Yes'. MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is a flavor enhancer commonly used in food production. It is known to cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, and flushing in some people when consumed in large quantities. However, the question asks about scientific proof of harm in small doses. Research has shown that MSG can have adverse effects on certain populations, including those with high blood pressure or a history of migraines. Studies have also found that MSG may contribute to weight gain and insulin resistance in individuals who consume it regularly. Overall, while MSG is generally considered safe for most people when consumed in moderation, there is evidence to suggest that it can cause harm in small doses for certain individuals. Therefore, it is important to be aware of potential risks and to consume MSG in moderation. [end of text]
