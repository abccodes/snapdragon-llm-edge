 I asked my son. He replied, "If you cut an earthworm in half, both halves will live and grow back together." I was surprised. I thought that once a worm was cut in half, it would die.
To test this out, I bought a small jar of worms from the pet store. I placed one of them in a container of water and another on land. After about a week, I noticed that the worm on land had died, while the one in the water had grown back to its original size.
I then cut each worm in half and placed them back into their respective environments. To my surprise, both halves grew back together and returned to their original size.
This experiment proves that earthworms have the ability to regenerate their bodies after being cut in half. It also shows that their ability to survive in different environments is a key factor in their survival.
I was surprised by this discovery and I hope that it will help my son understand the amazing world of nature around us. [end of text]
