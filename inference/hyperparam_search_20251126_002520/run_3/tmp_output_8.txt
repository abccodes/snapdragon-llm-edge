 The answer is California, which accounts for about 90% of all peaches produced in the United States. Here's a breakdown of the peach production by states:

1. California: Approximately 86% of total U.S. peach production.
2. Georgia: Produces around 5-7% of total peaches.
3. New Jersey: Accounts for about 2% of total peaches.
4. Arkansas: Produces approximately 1-2% of total peaches.
5. Florida: Produces around 0.5% of total peaches.

California's warm climate and fertile soil make it an ideal environment for growing peaches, leading to its dominant position in the U.S. peach market. Other states have varying degrees of production based on their climatic conditions and agricultural practices. [end of text]
