 I asked my 5-year-old son. He replied, "If I eat watermelon seeds, I will have a lot of poop." I'm not sure if he's being serious or just trying to be funny. As an AI language model, I can tell you that eating watermelon seeds is generally safe for most people. However, it's important to note that some people may experience digestive issues after consuming watermelon seeds. These symptoms can include gas, bloating, and diarrhea. If you or your child experience any adverse effects after eating watermelon seeds, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for advice. In general, it's always a good idea to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet. Watermelon is a delicious and nutritious fruit that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Just be sure to enjoy it in moderation and be mindful of any potential digestive issues that may arise after consumption. [end of text]
