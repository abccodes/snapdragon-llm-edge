 The answer to this question is often cited as 10%, but this is not accurate. In reality, it is impossible for any part of the brain to be completely inactive at any given time.
The brain is constantly active and engaged in various functions, including processing information, making decisions, and controlling movements. While some areas of the brain may be more active than others depending on the task at hand, no single area can be considered entirely inactive.
Furthermore, it's important to note that the idea of using only 10% of the brain is a myth that has been perpetuated by popular culture for many years. This myth has been debunked by numerous scientific studies and experts in the field of neuroscience.
In conclusion, while it may seem like we are only using a small percentage of our brains at any given time, in reality, all parts of the brain are constantly engaged in various functions and no single area can be considered entirely inactive. [end of text]
