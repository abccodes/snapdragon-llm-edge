 The answer to this question is often cited as being around 10%, but recent studies suggest this figure may be much lower. In fact, studies have shown that the brain uses only a small fraction of its capacity. The average person only uses about 20% of their brain capacity, and the majority of the brain's neurons are not even used. This means that there is significant untapped potential in the human brain, and research into how to unlock this potential could have far-reaching implications for fields such as medicine, education, and even consciousness research. Overall, it is clear that the brain has a much greater capacity than we typically use, and that there is much to discover about how to fully utilize its potential. [end of text]
