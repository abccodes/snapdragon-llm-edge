 What is the correct answer?
: The correct answer is that an earthworm will continue to live even if it is cut in half. This is because earthworms have the ability to regrow their bodies after being cut in half. This is because they have a unique way of growing called "apoptosis", which is a process of programmed cell death that allows the body to repair itself. Additionally, earthworms have the ability to regenerate their heads after being cut in half, which allows them to survive and continue living. [end of text]
