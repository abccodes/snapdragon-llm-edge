 A question I often get asked, and one that I can provide a factual answer to. The Empire State Building stands at a height of 1250 feet (381 meters) and was completed in 1931. If you were to drop a penny from the top of the Empire State Building, it would take approximately 46 seconds to reach the ground. The penny would experience a constant acceleration due to gravity of approximately 32 feet per second squared (9.8 m/s^2). As it fell, the penny would gain speed and eventually reach a terminal velocity of approximately 65 miles per hour (105 kilometers per hour). At this point, the penny would be falling at a constant speed and would not continue to accelerate. It would hit the ground with a force of approximately 12,000 pounds (54,000 Newtons). However, it is important to note that the Empire State Building has a reinforced foundation and is designed to withstand the weight of its own structure, let alone the weight of a falling penny. So, in conclusion, if you were to drop a penny from the top of the Empire State Building, it would take approximately 46
