 Yes, MSG (monosodium glutamate) has been scientifically proven to be harmful to humans in small doses. Studies have shown that high levels of MSG consumption can lead to symptoms such as headache, nausea, and flushing. Some studies have also suggested that MSG may have long-term effects on the brain, such as damage to nerve cells and changes in brain function. However, the evidence for these long-term effects is still inconclusive. Overall, it is generally recommended that people consume MSG in moderation and avoid large doses to minimize the risk of negative health effects. [end of text]
