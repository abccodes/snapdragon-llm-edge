Veins appear blue because they contain deoxygenated blood, which reflects blue wavelengths more strongly than red wavelengths. This is in contrast to arteries, which carry oxygenated blood and appear red. The color of veins is also influenced by the skin's pigmentation and the angle at which they are viewed. Veins that are closer to the skin's surface and at a lower angle will appear more blue than those that are deeper or at a higher angle. Veins that contain a lot of blood will appear darker and more blue than those that contain less blood. Veins that are near the skin's surface will also appear more blue than those that are deeper or underground.
