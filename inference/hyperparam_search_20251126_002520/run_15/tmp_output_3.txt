 The answer to this question is subjective and can vary depending on the individual's tolerance for heat and the type of chili pepper they are referring to. However, some popular opinions include:

1. Capsaicin: This is the active ingredient that gives chili peppers their heat. It is found in the inner membranes and seeds of the pepper.

2. Inner membranes: Many people believe that the inner membranes of a chili pepper are the hottest part, as they contain the highest concentration of capsaicin.

3. Seeds: The seeds of a chili pepper are also a common source of heat, as they contain a significant amount of capsaicin.

4. Skin: Some people believe that the skin of a chili pepper is the hottest part, as it contains a thin layer of capsaicin.

Overall, there is no single "spiciest part" of a chili pepper, as heat levels can vary greatly depending on the individual and the specific chili pepper being referred to. [end of text]
