 asks a young student. The teacher explains that this is due to the way light passes through our skin and how it interacts with blood.

The teacher continues, "As light travels through your body's tissues, some of it gets absorbed or scattered in different directions. Blue light has shorter wavelengths than red light, so when it enters your veins through your skin, less blue light gets absorbed compared to other colors."

"But why do we see the veins as dark instead?" asks a student who is still curious.

The teacher responds, "When you look at veins from the outside of your body, they appear darker because they are absorbing more red and green wavelengths. This causes them to absorb the most visible light, making them less noticeable against lighter skin tones."

Finally, the teacher adds, "Understanding how colors interact with our bodies can help us appreciate different aspects of human anatomy and physiology."

The young student nods thoughtfully, realizing that there is much more to learn about the world around them. [end of text]
