 The answer is California, which accounts for about 90% of all peach production in America.
```python
# Define a function to calculate total peach acres based on given states and their respective percentage contributions

def total_peach_acres(states):
    # Calculate the sum of each state's contribution multiplied by its acreage per year (1,256)
    
    return 0
    
total = 0 

states_data = {
            'California': {'peaches_per_year' : 48793,
                "acress": 1.256},
             # Assume all other states produce the same amount as California
              }
 
# Call function with a dictionary of peach-producing states and their respective acreage per year (in acres)
print(total_peach_acres(states_data['California']))  
```
```python
total = total + 1.256 * states_data[ 'peaches_per_year' ]
    return "Total Peach Acres: "+ str( round( total,3 ) )
result= function(" California")
 print(result) 
print('The state with the most peache is :'+states)
