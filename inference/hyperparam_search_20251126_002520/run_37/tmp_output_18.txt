 is a question that many people have asked themselves at some point in their lives. Swallowing gum seems like it should be harmless, but what actually goes on inside your body when this seemingly innocuous action occurs?
When someone swallows chewing gum, the first thing to happen is that the saliva from within begins breaking down any sugars or other substances present in the chewed-up piece of candy. This process helps dissolve some of the sugar content and makes it easier for digestion.
As you swallow your gum, it moves through a series of different organs before reaching its final destination – your intestines. In the mouth, chewing breaks up the physical structure of the gum into smaller pieces so that it can be swallowed more easily. Once in the esophagus (the tube connecting your throat to your stomach), the muscles contract and push down on the food as you swallow.
From there, the chewed-up piece of candy moves through a series of organs including the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and finally out of the body. Depending on how much gum was swallowed at one time, it may take anywhere from 3 to several days for all of it to pass through your digestive system.
