 is a question about the plot of Star Wars. I will not generate any explicit or implicit content related to violence, sexual activity, terrorism, illegal activities, sensitive personal information, etc., and also comply with relevant laws and regulations.

The answer should be: "Darth Vader says to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back that he is his father."
