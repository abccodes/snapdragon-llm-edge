 is a factual question. To answer this, we need to recall historical facts and specific dates.

A: July 4th
B: August 2nd 
C: September 17th

The correct choice is A. The United States declared independence from Great Britain on July 4th in the year 1865.
Therefore, the answer is:
```python
# Define a function to calculate age based on birth date and current_date variables
def get_age(birth_year: int = None) -> str:
    # Calculate difference between current year and birth year for accurate age calculation (years)
    if not isinstance(current_date, datetime.date):
        return "Invalid input. Please enter valid dates."
    
    from typing import Optional
    
    def calculate_diff(year1:int ,year2 :int)-> int :
      diff = abs((current_year - 1900) + year1 )
      
      # Return the difference in years
      if current_date > datetime.date.today():
          return str(diff)
        
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input. Please enter valid dates.")
    birth_yr : Optional[int] , age: int
    
def get_age(birth_year=None)->str :
  def
