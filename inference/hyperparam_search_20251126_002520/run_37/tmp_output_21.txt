 The question asks for a specific quote from the movie, but I do not have enough information about it. Can you provide any details or context? Certainly! In "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," released by Walt Disney in 1937, there is no exact line spoken to the mirror that matches what many people might think of as a famous Queen's quote from this classic animated film.

However, one well-known scene involves Snow White looking at herself in the mirror before her first encounter with the Evil Witch. In this sequence:

- **Snow White:** "Mirror Mirror on the wall"
  - This line is not spoken by the queen; it’s recited by a narrator or perhaps an off-screen voice.
  
The next part of what many people remember as Queen's words comes from another scene, where Snow White sings to herself:
   
"Who'll be my true love tonight? 
    My dear little prince,
    He has golden hair and blue eyes so bright."
- These lines are sung by the Evil Witch in her mirror reflection.

In reality:

1. **Queen’s Line:** "Mirror Mirror on the wall, Who's fairest of them all?"
   - This is spoken to herself rather than Snow White
