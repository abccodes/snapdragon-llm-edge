Additionally, if one half is left with its head end intact, this section will not regenerate while a worm can regrow almost any lost segment as long as it has some tissue from the original body to work with.

So in short: If an earthworm were cut into two halves (one part being without both ends), neither piece would survive because they are dependent on each other for reproduction and regeneration. [end of text]
