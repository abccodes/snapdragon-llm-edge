 According to Christian tradition as described in Genesis 2-3 of the Book of Moses (in the Old Testament), Adam and Eve were tempted by Satan into eating an apple from a tree called "the Tree of Knowledge" located at God's garden, which is often referred to as the Garden of Eden. The fruit was said to be forbidden because it would give them knowledge about good and evil.

It should also note that there are many different versions in Christian tradition regarding this story, some say they ate an apple while others mention a pomegranate or another type of fruit.
But traditionally, Adam and Eve were tempted by Satan into eating the "forbidden" tree's Fruit which is often referred to as the Apple. [end of text]
