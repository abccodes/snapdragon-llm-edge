 asked my 10-year-old son. I was tempted to say something along the lines that it wouldn't hurt because pennies are made out of thin metal, but then he reminded me how serious this question is for him.
I decided instead to do some research on what would happen if a penny were dropped from such an enormous height and share my findings with you. Let's begin:
How high must the drop be?
The Empire State Building stands at 1250 feet (381 meters) tall, which makes it one of the tallest buildings in the world.
If we assume that the building is perfectly straight up and down (which might not always be true), then a penny dropped from its top would fall for approximately:
- Approximately 4.9 seconds at ground level
But since this isn't exactly how things work, there are some factors to consider when calculating just how high you'd need to drop the penny.
Firstly, air resistance will play an important role in slowing down our falling friend as it approaches Earth's surface.
Secondly, if we were able to ignore all of these obstacles and let a perfect penny fall from space (which would be impossible), then its speed upon impact with ground level would be approximately
