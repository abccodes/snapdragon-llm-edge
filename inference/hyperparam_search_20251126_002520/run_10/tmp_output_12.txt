 is a question that can be answered by using reasoning. The answer to this question is likely to be found in historical records or music databases.
To reason about this question, we need to consider who was active as a composer during the time period when "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" became popular. One possible answer could be William Sterndale Bennett, an English composer and pianist who lived from 1794 to 1865.
Another possibility is that the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" was composed by someone else entirely, such as a child or a musician who wrote it for fun. In this case, we would need more information about when and where the song became popular in order to determine its authorship with certainty.
Overall, while there may be some uncertainty surrounding the exact identity of the composer of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," using reasoning and historical research can help us narrow down the possibilities and arrive at a likely answer. [end of text]
