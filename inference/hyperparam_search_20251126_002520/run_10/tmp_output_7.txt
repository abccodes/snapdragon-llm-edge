 This question is often asked to test one's knowledge about physics and the effects of falling objects. The answer, however, may surprise some people.
If you were standing on the ground below an object that fell straight down from a great height like the Empire State Building (which stands at 1350 feet or approximately 412 meters), there is no way for you to survive if it falls directly onto your head. The force of impact would be extremely high, and it could cause serious injury or even death.
However, things are not as simple when the object in question is a penny dropped from such a great height. A penny has a relatively small mass compared to other objects that might fall from a similar height, so its kinetic energy upon impact with the ground would be much lower than if it were something heavier like a brick or a rock.
In fact, even though a penny falling from the top of the Empire State Building could potentially cause injury or death due to the force of impact, the likelihood of this happening is extremely low. The penny would likely break upon hitting the ground and not pose any significant threat to anyone standing below it.
So while a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building may seem like an unlikely scenario
