 is a question that can be answered using reasoning and knowledge about agriculture in different states of the United States.
To answer this question, we need to know which state has the highest production of peaches in the country. We can use data from reliable sources such as USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) or other agricultural organizations to find out which state produces the most peaches.
After researching and analyzing the available data, it is clear that Georgia is the leading producer of peaches in the United States. According to NASS data for 2019, Georgia produced a total of 376 million pounds of peaches, followed closely by California with 285 million pounds and Florida with 245 million pounds.
Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that Georgia produces the most peaches in the United States. [end of text]
