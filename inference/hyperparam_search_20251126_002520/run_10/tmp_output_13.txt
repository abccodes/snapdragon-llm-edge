: If an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will continue to grow and develop into whole worms. This process is known as regeneration.
Earthworms have a unique ability to regenerate their bodies after being damaged or injured. When an earthworm is cut in half, each half has the potential to regrow its head, tail, and other body parts.
The growth of new tissues occurs through cell division and differentiation, which are processes that occur naturally in all living organisms. In the case of earthworms, these processes allow them to regenerate their bodies after being damaged or injured.
It's worth noting that not all species of worms have this ability. Some species may be able to regrow certain parts of their body, while others may only be able to regenerate a limited number of tissues. Earthworms are one of the few species that can completely regenerate their entire body after being cut in half. [end of text]
