 asks an online forum. The question is based on the popular urban legend that pennies have been known to survive falls from great heights.

To answer this, we need to calculate how much energy a falling object has and whether it could cause damage upon impact.
The formula for calculating potential energy (PE) of an object at rest due to its height above ground level is:
 PE = mgh
where,
m= mass of the penny in kilograms 
g = acceleration due to gravity, 9.81 meters per second squared  
h = distance from which it falls

For a standard US quarter weighing approximately 5 grams (0.02 kg), and falling from the top floor of an Empire State Building (approximately 367 feet or about 112 m high):

PE= (mgh) 
(0.02kg)(9.81m/s^2)*(112 meters)
 PE = approximately 4,534 Joules

The kinetic energy (KE) of the penny upon impact can be calculated using:
 KE=(mv)^2/2
where,
v= velocity at which it hits ground 

To find out how fast a falling object is moving when hitting the surface, we
