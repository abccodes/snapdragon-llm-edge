A study published by the journal "Food and Chemical Toxicology" found that MSG may have some adverse effects on human health, including headaches, nausea, flushing of skin, etc., especially for people with a genetic predisposition to sensitivity to glutamate. However, these symptoms are usually temporary and do not cause serious harm when consumed in small doses.

Another study published by the journal "Toxicology Letters" found that MSG may have some long-term effects on human health, including changes in brain function and memory impairment. These studies suggest that people with a genetic predisposition to sensitivity to glutamate should avoid consuming large amounts of MSG for extended periods.

In summary, while there is evidence suggesting that small doses of MSG can cause adverse reactions such as headaches or flushing skin, the long-term effects on human health are still not fully understood and require further research. Therefore, it's important to consume food in moderation and choose products with less added flavor enhancers when possible. [end of text]
