 This question has been debated among food enthusiasts for years. While some believe it's the seeds, others argue that it’s actually the flesh around them.
To determine which one is correct, we need to understand how chilis are made and what makes them spicy in the first place. Chilies contain a compound called capsaicin, which gives them their heat or spiciness.
Capsaicin is found primarily in the seeds of chili peppers but can also be present in other parts such as the flesh around them. The amount of capsainc varies depending on factors like breed and growing conditions, so it's not always easy to predict where you'll find more capsaicin.
In general, however, most people agree that the seeds are usually considered the spiciest part of a chili pepper because they contain higher levels of capsaicin. The flesh around them can still be spicy but generally contains less capsaicin than the seeds themselves.
So while there may not be one definitive answer to this question, it's clear that both the seeds and the surrounding flesh are important sources of spiciess in chili peppers! [end of text]
