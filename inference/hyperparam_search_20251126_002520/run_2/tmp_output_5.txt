 is a question that has been asked for centuries. The answer, however, may surprise you.
The reason why matadores use red capes in bullfighting is not because they are trying to attract the bulls attention or make them angry. In fact, it's quite the opposite!
Red was chosen as the color of choice for a few reasons:
1) Red stands out against green grass and trees: This makes it easier for the matador to see where he needs to go.
2) Bulls have poor eyesight in red light: They are more likely to attack something that is moving quickly, which can be achieved by waving the cape around rapidly. The bull's inability to distinguish between colors also means they may not realize what color the capes actually are!
3) Red has a calming effect on bulls: Some believe this could help keep them calm during the fight.
So next time you watch a matador perform, remember that he is using red for more than just showmanship! [end of text]
