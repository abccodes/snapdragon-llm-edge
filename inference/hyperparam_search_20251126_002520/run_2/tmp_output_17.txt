 is an example of what type of question?
A) A factual statement
B) An opinion-based query
C) A hypothetical scenario inquiry

The correct answer to this question would be C: Hypothetical Scenario Inquiry.

This kind of question asks about the potential outcomes or consequences under specific circumstances, which falls into the category of a "hypothical" type. It is not asking for factual information (A), nor does it express an opinion (B). Instead, it's seeking to understand what might happen in certain conditions - how long one should wait between eating and swimming.

Therefore, C) Hypothesis Scenario Inquiry accurately describes the nature of this question. [end of text]
