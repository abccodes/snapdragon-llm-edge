 I'm trying to answer this question for my history class.
fortune cookies are a symbol of good fortune and are often served at Chinese restaurants. However, their origin is not known with certainty. Some historians believe that fortune cookies originated in Japan, while others believe that they originated in China. The first reference to fortune cookies in the United States was in 1918, in a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco. Today, fortune cookies are widely associated with Chinese cuisine, but they are not actually a traditional Chinese dish. They are simply a way to provide a symbolic gesture of good fortune to customers. The exact origin of fortune cookies remains a mystery. However, it is clear that they have become an important part of Chinese-American culture and are often served at Chinese restaurants around the world. [end of text]
