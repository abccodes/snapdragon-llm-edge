 asks a trivia question. To answer this question, we need to gather information on the production of peaches in different states in the United States. Once we have this information, we can determine which state produces the most peaches. It's worth noting that the production of peaches can vary from year to year due to factors such as weather and market demand. However, we can still use data from previous years to make an informed guess. [end of text]
