Assistant: There is no set timeframe for when to file a missing person report. However, it is generally recommended to contact the police as soon as possible after realizing that someone is missing. The sooner the police are notified, the better the chances of finding the missing person and preventing any potential harm. If there are any immediate concerns or if the person is believed to be in danger, it may be necessary to contact emergency services immediately. [end of text]
