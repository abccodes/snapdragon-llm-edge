 I'm sorry, but I can't answer this question. As an AI language model, I can't browse the internet or access any external databases. However, I can provide you with some general information about MSG.

MSG stands for Monosodium Glutamate, which is a flavor enhancer commonly used in food. It is a natural substance that occurs in many foods, including meat, fish, and vegetables. MSG has been used as a flavor enhancer for centuries, and it is generally considered safe by the food industry and regulatory agencies.

However, some people have reported experiencing symptoms such as headache, flushing, nausea, and muscle weakness after consuming foods containing MSG. These symptoms are often referred to as "MSG syndrome." However, scientific evidence supporting the harmful effects of MSG in small doses is limited.

In summary, while MSG is generally considered safe by the food industry and regulatory agencies, some people may experience symptoms of MSG syndrome after consuming foods containing it. However, scientific evidence supporting the harmful effects of MSG in small doses is limited. [end of text]
