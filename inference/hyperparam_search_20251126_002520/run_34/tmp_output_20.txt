 Why should I not sit close to the television? Sitting close to the television can cause eye strain and discomfort, especially when watching for extended periods of time. It can also increase the risk of nearsightedness or other eye problems if done frequently. Additionally, sitting close to the television can make it harder to see the picture clearly, which can be frustrating and distracting. It is generally recommended to sit at least 2 to 3 feet away from the television to minimize these issues and enjoy a comfortable viewing experience. [end of text]
