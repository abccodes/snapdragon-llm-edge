 Fortune cookies are a traditional treat in Chinese-American cuisine, but their origin is less clear. Some believe they originated in China during the Qing Dynasty, while others think they were brought to America by Japanese immigrants in the 19th century. The truth is likely somewhere in between. Fortune cookies were first mentioned in print in 1918 in a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco, and their popularity grew rapidly in the following years. Today, fortune cookies are a beloved part of Chinese-American culture, and are often served as a sweet ending to a meal. While their exact origin may be unknown, one thing is clear: they are a delicious and meaningful treat that brings people together. [end of text]
