 This is a common question that many people have. The answer may surprise you!

If an earthworm is cut in half, it will not die immediately. Instead, the two halves will continue to live and move for a short period of time. However, the halves will eventually die.

The reason for this is that an earthworm has a closed circulatory system. This means that the blood flows through vessels and is distributed throughout the body. When an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves become isolated from each other and the blood vessels that connect them. Without a continuous supply of blood, the two halves will eventually die.

In addition, the halves of an earthworm will not be able to reproduce after being cut in half. This is because the two halves do not have the same number of reproductive organs. One half will have reproductive organs, while the other half will not.

Overall, while an earthworm may continue to move and live for a short period of time after being cut in half, the two halves will eventually die. This is due to the closed circulatory system of the earthworm and the lack of reproductive organs in the two halves. [end of text]
