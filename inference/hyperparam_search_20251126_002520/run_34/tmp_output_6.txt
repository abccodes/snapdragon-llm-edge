Some people believe that humans only use a small percentage of their brains, while others believe that we use all of our brains. The truth is that we use different parts of our brains for different tasks, and we may not use the same parts of our brains for all tasks.

A study by neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga in the 1990s found that people can perform tasks that involve both hemispheres of the brain, suggesting that we use all parts of our brains. However, other research suggests that we may not use all parts of our brains for all tasks.

So, to answer the question: We do not know exactly how much of the brain we typically use, and it is likely that we use different parts of our brains for different tasks. It is also important to note that our brains are incredibly complex, and there is still much to learn about how they work. [end of text]
