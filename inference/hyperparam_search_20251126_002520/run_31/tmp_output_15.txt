 Is this a reasonable question?

MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is an excitatory amino acid commonly used as a flavor enhancer. It's often added to foods like Chinese cuisine and processed meats. However, some people claim that it can cause negative health effects such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, etc., especially in small doses.

In terms of scientific research, there have been many studies on MSG and its potential harmful effects on humans. Some studies suggest that MSG is safe to consume at normal levels (less than 5 grams per day), while others claim that it can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, etc., especially in sensitive individuals.

Therefore, the answer to your question depends on who you believe and what sources of information you trust. It's important to note that there is still much research needed to fully understand the potential effects of MSG on human health. [end of text]
