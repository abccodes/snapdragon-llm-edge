 This is one of the most frequently asked questions about bullfighting. The answer to this question can be found in history, tradition and a bit of science.
The origin of the use of red cloth by matadors dates back many centuries. According to historical records, it was first used in Spain during the 16th century as part of the costume worn by the bullfighters. It is believed that the color red was chosen because bulls are naturally drawn to this color and may be more aggressive when they see it.
Today, red capes continue to play an important role in a matador's performance. They serve several purposes:
1. To distract the bull: The red cape helps to keep the bull focused on the moving cloth rather than the matador himself. This can help prevent the bull from charging at him unexpectedly.
2. To create drama and excitement: Red is often associated with danger or passion, so using a red cape adds an element of excitement and tension to the performance.
3. To show off skills: Matadors who are skilled in their use of the red cape are considered to be highly proficient bullfighters. They may perform complex maneuvers such as throwing the cape over their shoulder or tossing it into the air while riding the bull
