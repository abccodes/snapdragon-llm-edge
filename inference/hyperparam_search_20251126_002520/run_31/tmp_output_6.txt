 This is a common question that has been debated for many years. While there are some interesting theories about how much of our brains we actually use, it's important to note that there is no definitive answer.
There have been several studies and experiments conducted over the past century to determine just how much of our brains we typically use. Some researchers believe that humans only use a small percentage of their brain capacity, while others argue that we are capable of using all parts of our brains in various ways.
One study published in 1986 by neuroscientist John Medina found that people only activate about 20% of the neurons in their brains at any given time. This means that there is a significant amount of unused brain capacity available for us to tap into if we choose to do so.
However, other researchers have criticized this study and argue that it overstates our ability to use all parts of our brains. They point out that many functions of the human body are controlled by subconscious processes, which means that we may not be consciously aware of how much of our brain capacity is being used at any given time.
Ultimately, while there is no definitive answer to this question, it's clear that humans have a vast amount of unused brain capacity available for
