 Why should we avoid sitting too close to a TV?
To answer this question, let's break down some of the key reasons why it might not be ideal to sit very close to your TV:
1. Eye Strain: Sitting too close to the TV can cause eye strain because the image will appear much larger and more detailed than it actually is. This can make it harder for your eyes to focus, which can lead to headaches or other visual discomfort.
2. Reduced Picture Quality: When you sit too close to a TV, the picture quality may suffer because of things like blurriness or loss of detail. The closer you are to the screen, the more difficult it will be for your eyes to see all of the tiny details that make up the image.
3. Potential Health Risks: Sitting too close to a TV can also pose some potential health risks. For example, if you sit very close to the screen and then look away suddenly, there is a risk of getting a "black eye" or other injury to your eyes. Additionally, spending long periods of time sitting in front of a bright screen can cause blue light sensitivity and disrupt sleep patterns.
Overall, it's generally recommended that you maintain at least 10-12
