 Answer: J. S. Bach.
J.S.Bach was a German composer and organist whose work includes some well-known pieces such as Brandenburg Concertos, fugues, cantatas, etc., but his "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is not among them. The tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" originated in England in the 18th century and was originally titled "The Stars at Night." In 1930, it was set to music by Richard Shurmer and published as a children's song under the title "Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells," which is more widely known today. Therefore, J.S.Bach did not compose the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." [end of text]
