 is a question about the plot of the movie "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980), which was directed by George Lucas. In this film, the character Darth Vader delivers several lines to his son Luke Skywalker during their confrontation on Dagobah.

Here's an example answer:
Darth Vader says to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back: "You will be my apprentice."
This line is one of many memorable quotes from the movie that have become iconic cultural references. Other notable lines include:

1. **"No, I am your father."** - Darth Vader to Anakin Skywalker.
2. **"I find your lack of faith disturbing."** - Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker.
3. **"You were the chosen one."** - Yoda to Luke Skywalker.

These quotes contribute significantly to the plot and character development in "The Empire Strikes Back," setting up events for the final confrontation between the characters in the next installment, "Return of the Jedi."
