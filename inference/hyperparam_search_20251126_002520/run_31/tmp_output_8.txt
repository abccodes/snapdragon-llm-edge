 The answer is California.
To determine which U.S. state produces the most peaches, we need to compare the peach production of different states over a period of time.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **California**: This state consistently ranks as one of the leading producers of peaches in the United States. It has favorable climatic conditions and extensive orchards dedicated to growing peaches.
2. **Georgia**: Georgia is another major producer, known for its sweet peaches. The state's climate and soil make it an ideal environment for peach cultivation.
3. **New Jersey**: While New Jersey isn't typically associated with fruit production due to cooler climates, some areas in the eastern part of the state have managed to establish successful peach orchards.
4. **Washington State**: Washington also produces peaches, though not as extensively as California or Georgia.

Based on these factors and historical data, it's reasonable to conclude that:

**California is likely the leading producer of peaches in the United States**, followed closely by Georgia.

Therefore, the answer to your question "What U.S. state produces the most peaches?" is **California**. [end of text]
