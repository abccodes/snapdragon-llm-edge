 This is one of the most common questions I get asked. It's not only about the time gap, but also what to eat before swimming.
Most people think that they need to avoid eating for at least an hour or two before swimming. However, this isn't always necessary.
The general rule is to wait at least 2 hours after a meal before going for a swim. This allows your body to digest the food properly and prevent any discomfort or cramping during exercise.
However, if you're not feeling well after eating, it's better to avoid swimming altogether until you feel up to it.
If you decide to eat something light before swimming, make sure it's easily digested and doesn't contain too much fat. Good options include fruits like bananas or grapes, nuts, yogurt, or a small piece of toast with honey.
Remember that everyone is different, so pay attention to how your body feels after eating and exercising. If you notice any discomfort or cramping, try waiting longer before swimming next time.
In summary, the general rule is to wait at least 2 hours after a meal before going for a swim. However, if you're not feeling well after eating, it's better to avoid swimming altogether until you feel up to it
