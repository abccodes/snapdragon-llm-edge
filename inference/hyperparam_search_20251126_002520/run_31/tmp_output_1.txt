 Fortune cookies originated in China and were introduced to the United States during the late 19th century. They became popular as a dessert for Chinese restaurants, where they are often served with dim sum or other dishes.
Today, fortune cookies can be found at many different types of establishments around the world, including bakeries, convenience stores, and even online retailers. Despite their popularity, there is no definitive answer to the question of who invented them or when exactly they were first created, as the origins of this traditional Chinese dessert are shrouded in mystery.
However, one popular legend suggests that fortune cookies originated during a time when Japanese immigrants were being discriminated against and oppressed in America. It was said that these immigrants would hide messages of hope and encouragement inside their food to help them cope with their difficult circumstances.
While there is no evidence to support this specific story, it does highlight the cultural significance of fortune cookies as symbols of hope and resilience. Today, they continue to be a beloved dessert around the world, enjoyed by people of all ages for their sweet taste and meaningful messages. [end of text]
