 

 "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is a classic animated Disney movie released in 1937. The story follows a young princess named Snow White who becomes trapped by an evil queen after she accidentally kills her stepmother with poison.

In the film, there is a memorable scene where Snow White goes to see her reflection in a mirror and says "Mirror Mirror on the wall." However, the exact words that the Queen says to her mirror are not known for certain. There have been many different versions of this line throughout history, including some variations with rhymes or other wording.

It's worth noting that Disney has never officially released an audio recording of the Queen's dialogue in this scene, so it's impossible to know exactly what she said without relying on fan theories and interpretations. Some people believe that she might have said something like "Mirror Mirror on the wall, who is fairest of them all?" or "Mirror mirror on the wall, how do I look today?"

Overall, while we don't have a definitive answer to this question, there are many different versions of what the Queen says in this scene and they continue to be debated by fans of Disney's classic animated films. [end of text]
