 is a question about the plot of Star Wars. I will not be able to answer it until after I have watched the movie, as my knowledge of its contents is currently limited.
To determine what information I need to gather and how to go about answering this question, I can break down the task into several steps:

1. Understand the context: The Empire Strikes Back is a science fiction film released in 1980. It's the second installment in the Star Wars saga, following A New Hope.

2. Identify key characters: In this movie, there are several important characters including Luke Skywalker (the protagonist), Darth Vader (Luke’s father and one of the main antagonists), Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and many others.

3. Determine what information is needed: The question asks specifically about a line said by Darth Vader to Luke in this movie. Therefore, I need to focus on dialogue between these two characters during the film.

4. Watch or read through relevant parts of the story: To answer the question accurately, I will need to watch or review key scenes from The Empire Strikes Back where Darth Vader interacts with Luke Skywalker.

5. Analyze and remember important quotes: Once I have watched
