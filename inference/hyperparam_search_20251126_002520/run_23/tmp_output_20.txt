 My mother always said this. But I never understood why until recently. Now that I'm older, I understand why my mother was so worried about me sitting too close to the TV.

I can't remember exactly how old I was when I first started watching TV, but it seems like just yesterday. The reason for my mother's concern is quite simple - it has something to do with eye strain. If you sit too close to a television screen, your eyes have to work extra hard to focus on the picture. This can lead to eye strain and even permanent damage.

My mother always told me not to look at anything that was smaller than my thumb from more than about 18 inches away. She used this as an example of how far I should sit from a TV screen. If you sit closer, your eyes will have to work harder to focus on the picture and can become fatigued quickly.

I understand now why she was so worried about me sitting too close to the television. It's not just about being able to see clearly; it's also about protecting my eyes from potential damage in the long run.
It is true that I have experienced eye strain after watching TV for a long time, but I never thought it could be caused
