Assistant: The time to file a missing person report varies depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction. Generally, if someone is not accounted for after 72 hours, it may be advisable to contact local law enforcement or emergency services. However, this can vary based on factors such as the individual's age, health condition, and whether they have any known contacts or resources that could help locate them. It is always best to err on the side of caution and report a missing person immediately if you are concerned about their safety or well-being. [end of text]
