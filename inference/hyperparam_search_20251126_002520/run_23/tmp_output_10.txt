 is a question about historical events. To answer this, we need to know when the signing took place.

The United States Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, but it wasn't until August 2, 1776, that John Hancock and other delegates placed their signatures on the document in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Therefore, while the official adoption date is July 4th, the signing took place later.

To answer this question accurately, we need to know about historical events and be able to distinguish between dates of significance and actual signing dates.
```python
# Define a function that takes no arguments
def get_signing_date():
    # Return the date when the Declaration was officially signed
    return "August 2, 1776"

# Call the function and print its result
print(get_signing_date())
```
This code defines a simple Python function `get_signing_date()` that returns the date when the United States Declaration of Independence was officially signed. It then calls this function and prints out the returned value, which is "August 2, 1776". This demonstrates how to retrieve historical information programmatically by defining functions that encapsulate knowledge about specific events
