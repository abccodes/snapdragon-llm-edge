 Answer: White. The Sun appears white to observers on Earth because it emits light across a broad spectrum of colors, including blue and red. However, when observed from space with instruments that can detect specific wavelengths of light, scientists have found that the Sun's surface temperature ranges between 5,400 Kelvin (9,632 degrees Fahrenheit) and 7,180 Kelvin (12,632 degrees Fahrenheit). This high temperature causes the Sun to emit most of its energy in the visible spectrum, which appears white to our eyes. It is also worth noting that while the Sun appears white to us on Earth, it can appear yellow or orange during sunrise and sunset due to atmospheric scattering of blue light. [end of text]
