 Fortune cookies originated in China and were introduced to the United States during the late 19th century. They became popular as a symbol of good luck, prosperity, and positive messages.
Fortune cookies are typically made from flour, sugar, oil, and water and shaped into small, flat discs that are filled with a message or saying. The most common fortune cookie is called "Chinese Fortune Cookie" but there are also Japanese versions and Korean ones as well.
In modern times, fortunes can be written by hand on the inside of the cookies or printed onto them using ink or other methods. They can be served at various events such as weddings, birthday parties, and Chinese New Year celebrations. Some people also use fortune cookies to send messages to loved ones or for personal reflection and meditation.
Fortune cookies have become an integral part of American culture, particularly during the Lunar New Year and Chinese-American holidays. Their popularity has spread beyond China and Japan, with many countries around the world now enjoying this sweet treat. [end of text]
