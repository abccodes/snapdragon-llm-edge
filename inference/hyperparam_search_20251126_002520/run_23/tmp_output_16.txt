 This is a question that many people have asked themselves at some point. The answer to this question depends on several factors, including the temperature and humidity levels outside.
If it's very cold outside and there are high humidity levels, then going outside with wet hair can be problematic because your body will try to warm up by evaporating water from your skin. This process can cause you to feel chilly or even hypothermic if you're not properly dressed for the weather. In addition, the moisture in your hair can attract more cold air and make it feel colder.
On the other hand, if it's relatively mild outside with low humidity levels, then going outside with wet hair may be less problematic because your body won't have to work as hard to warm up by evaporating water from your skin. However, you should still consider covering your head or wearing a hat to keep your ears and scalp warm.
In summary, if you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, it's important to dress appropriately for the temperature and humidity levels outside. You may want to cover your head or wear a hat to protect your ears and scalp from the cold air. Additionally, be aware that the moisture in your hair can attract more cold air and make it feel colder
