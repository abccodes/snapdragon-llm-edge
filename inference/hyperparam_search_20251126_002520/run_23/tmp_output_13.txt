 The answer is that the two halves will grow back together. Earthworms have a special ability to regrow their bodies after being cut into pieces.
This phenomenon, known as regeneration, occurs because earthworms have what are called blastemas. Blastemas are specialized tissue regions located at certain points along an organism's body that can regenerate missing parts of the body when stimulated by appropriate signals from the surrounding environment.
In addition to having blastemas, earthworms also possess a number of other features that contribute to their ability to regrow their bodies after being cut into pieces. For example, they have a relatively simple nervous system and do not require complex repair mechanisms in order to regenerate missing parts of their body.
Overall, the ability of earthworms to regrow their bodies after being cut into pieces is an impressive testament to the remarkable biological capabilities of these fascinating creatures. While there are still many unanswered questions about how exactly this process works at a molecular and cellular level, it remains one of the most intriguing aspects of earthworm biology.
