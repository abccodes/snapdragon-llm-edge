 I asked.

You should avoid going outside in cold weather with wet hair because the cold wind can cause your hair to become even more wet and cold, which could lead to damage to your hair or scalp. Additionally, wet hair is more susceptible to getting chilled and can cause a chill to run down your back, which can make you feel uncomfortable or even sick.
It's also worth noting that cold weather with wet hair can increase the risk of hypothermia, especially if you are not properly dressed or have poor insulation in your clothing. So it's best to avoid going outside in cold weather with wet hair and instead try to get out of the elements as soon as possible. [end of text]
