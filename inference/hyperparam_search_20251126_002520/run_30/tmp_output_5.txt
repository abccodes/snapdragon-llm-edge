 - A popular question about bullfighting.
The reason for this tradition is as follows:
1. The color red is said to be the favorite color of the bull.
2. The red cape causes the bull to charge at it, thus making the fight more exciting and entertaining for the audience.
3. Red is also considered to be a lucky color in bullfighting, which adds to the excitement of the event.
4. The use of a red cape has become an important part of the tradition and culture of bullfighting, and is recognized all around the world as a symbol of this sport.
It's worth noting that today, most matadors use a white cape called "muleta" instead of a red one, but the traditional red cape is still widely used in some countries. [end of text]
