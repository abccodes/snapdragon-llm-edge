Studies have shown that every part of the brain is active during most tasks and that there is no evidence to support the idea that any significant portion of the brain remains unused. In fact, many areas of the brain are constantly engaged in various functions, such as sensory processing, memory, language, and executive functions. So while it may be true that we don't use every single neuron or connection in our brain, there is no evidence to suggest that we only use 10% of it.' [end of text]
