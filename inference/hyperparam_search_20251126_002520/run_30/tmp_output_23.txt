 What is the correct answer? The correct answer is: "The British are coming! The British are coming!" It's important to note that this quote has been widely used and misattributed over the years, and it's not necessarily accurate to attribute it directly to Paul Revere. However, the phrase "The British are coming! The British are coming!" has become synonymous with the idea of warning of an impending invasion or attack, which is what Paul Revere was likely trying to do during his famous midnight ride.
