 I'm curious to know who wrote this popular children's song. Can you help me with that?
: It is not known for certain who composed the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." However, it has been attributed to various composers over time. One theory suggests that the melody was written by Sir William Sterndale Bennett in 1807 and set to words by Jane Taylor in 1809. Another theory attributes the melody to an English composer named John Stanley in 1836.
In any case, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" has become one of the most popular children's songs in the world, with many different versions and arrangements over time. It is often used as a lullaby or bedtime song for young children, but it can also be enjoyed by people of all ages. [end of text]
