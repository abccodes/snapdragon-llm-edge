 A: The penny would bounce off your head. B: You would be crushed to death. C: You would suffer minor injuries. D: None of the above.
The correct answer is D: None of the above.

Here's why:

1. **Height and Force**: If a penny were dropped from the top of the Empire State Building (approximately 328 feet or about 99 meters), it would fall with significant velocity due to gravity. The impact force upon hitting an object, such as your head, can be substantial.

2. **Penetration Capability**: A standard penny is relatively small and made primarily of zinc-coated copper. It has a thickness of around 1.5 millimeters (0.06 inches). Even if it penetrates the skull, the impact force would likely cause severe damage to the brain tissues.

3. **Impact Surface Area**: The surface area of your head is much larger than that of a penny, which means the energy from the fall would be distributed over a wider area, potentially causing less direct trauma compared to hitting something smaller and harder like an object made of metal or bone.

4. **Energy Dissipation**: Human skull bones are designed to absorb some impact forces, but they
