: A worm can regenerate its body parts, including its head and tail. If an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will each grow a new head and tail, eventually forming two separate worms.

Here's how it works:

  * The top half of the worm (the front end) contains all the vital organs such as the brain, heart, digestive system, and reproductive organs. If this part is cut off, the bottom half can still survive for a while because it has some important functions like breathing through its skin.
  * The bottom half of the worm (the back end) also contains some vital organs, but not all of them are as essential as those in the top half. This means that if this part is cut off, the bottom half may be able to survive for a longer period of time.
  * Once both halves have grown new heads and tails, they will each become independent worms.

It's worth noting that while earthworms can regenerate their body parts, it takes some time for them to do so. The regeneration process can take anywhere from several days to several weeks depending on the species of worm and other factors such as environmental conditions.
Overall, cutting an earthworm in half is not a
