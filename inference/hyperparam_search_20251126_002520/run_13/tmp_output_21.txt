 The question is asking for a specific quote from the movie, but I can't find any reliable sources online. Can you help me with this?
't be able to provide an exact quote without more context or information about the source of the claim. However, there are some common quotes associated with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs that may have been misattributed to Queen Elizabeth II.
One such quote is: "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" This line is often attributed to Queen Elizabeth II in modern retellings of the story. However, it was actually spoken by Snow White herself in the original 1937 animated film.
Another popular quote that may have been misattributed to the queen is: "I'm not sure what I did wrong this time." This line was also spoken by Snow White in the original movie, and has since become a famous catchphrase associated with the character.
It's important to note that these quotes are often referenced in modern retellings of the story or as part of popular culture references. However, they may not be exactly what Queen Elizabeth II said in her personal life or during any specific event. [end of text]
