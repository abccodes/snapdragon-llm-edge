 Why should we avoid sitting too close to a TV?
There are several reasons why it is not recommended to sit too close to a television:

1. Eye strain: Sitting too close to a television can cause eye strain and headaches, especially if you have already been looking at screens for extended periods of time.

2. Blurry vision: The closer you get to the screen, the more difficult it will be to focus on what is being displayed. This can result in blurry or distorted images.

3. Health risks: Sitting too close to a television has also been linked to health problems such as neck and back pain, headaches, and eye strain.

4. Reduced viewing experience: Sitting too close to a television may reduce the overall quality of your viewing experience by reducing the contrast between dark and light areas on the screen.

Overall, it is generally recommended that you sit at least 10-12 feet away from a standard TV screen for optimal viewing comfort and quality. [end of text]
