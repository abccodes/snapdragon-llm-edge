 asks a young girl. A teacher answers, "If you have wet hair and step outside into cold weather, your hair will become even more wet because the air is very cold." The little girl then says, "That's not true! I've been to many places where it was raining or snowing, but my hair never got any wetter when we went outdoors. My friend John always has his hat on so he doesn't get wet in the rain, and he also keeps his ears warm by wearing ear muffs." The teacher then says, "That's a good point! Sometimes cold air can make your hair feel more damp because it makes you shiver and sweat, but if you stay dry, your hair will not become any wetter when you go outside in the rain or snow. So what should we do to keep our hair from getting wet when it rains?" The little girl says, "We could put on a hat and wear ear muffs like John does." A teacher then adds, "Good idea! When it's raining, make sure your head is covered with a hat and that you have ear protection so you won't get cold or wet. Also remember to take off any wet clothes as soon as possible after you
