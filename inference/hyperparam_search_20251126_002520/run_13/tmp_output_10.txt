 is a question about history. To answer this, we need to know when the United States declared its independence from Great Britain and when it finalized that declaration with signatures.

The correct answer to "When did the US declare independence?" is July 4th, but this refers to the date on which the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. The actual signing took place over several months, as some delegates were unable or unwilling to sign immediately. However, for practical purposes and historical recognition, most people associate the signing with August 2nd, 1776.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **August 2nd**. [end of text]
