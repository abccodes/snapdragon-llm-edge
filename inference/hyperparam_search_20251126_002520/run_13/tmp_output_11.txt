This is because sunlight travels through a layer of gas called the Earth's atmosphere, which scatters shorter wavelengths like blue and violet more effectively than longer wavelengths like red and orange. As a result, when we look at the sun from space, it appears white to our eyes, but its true color is actually blue.
The Sun has an average surface temperature of about 5,700 degrees Celsius (10,300 degrees Fahrenheit), making it one of the hottest objects in the universe. Its core temperature can reach up to 28 million degrees Celsius (50 million degrees Fahrenheit). Despite its high temperatures, however, the Sun is not actually a blue star like some other stars we see in the sky. Instead, it has a surface temperature that is relatively cool compared to other types of stars.
In summary, when viewed from space, the Sun appears white due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths. Its true color is actually blue, and its average surface temperature is about 5,700 degrees Celsius (10,300 degrees Fahrenheit). [end of text]
