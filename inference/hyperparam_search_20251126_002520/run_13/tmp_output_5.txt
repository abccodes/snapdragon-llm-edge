 is a question often asked by tourists and visitors to Spain. The answer, of course, is that they don't actually use red capes at all.
The confusion arises because the word "capa" in Spanish means both "cape" (as used for clothing) and "red". So when people see a matador waving something that looks like a cape but is not actually made of cloth, they assume it's a red cape.
In reality, matadors use what are called "estocadas", which are long swords with sharp blades. These estocadas are waved around by the matador as he performs his moves during a bullfight.
The red color that tourists often see is not on the sword itself, but rather on the clothing and accessories of the matador and other participants in the fight. The matador's costume, for example, typically includes a bright red cape called an "almafuera", which he uses to signal his position during the bullfight.
So while it may seem like the matadors are waving red capes, they're actually using long swords and colorful clothing to perform their artful moves. The confusion arises because of the Spanish word for both "cape" and "red". [end of text]
