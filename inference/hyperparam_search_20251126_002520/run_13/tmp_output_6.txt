 This is a common question that has been debated for many years. While there are some interesting theories about how much of our brains we actually use, it's important to note that there is no definitive answer.
There have been several studies and experiments conducted over the past century or so to try to determine how much of the brain we typically use. Some researchers believe that humans only use a small percentage of their brains, while others argue that we use almost all of our cognitive abilities at some point in time.
One popular theory is that humans only use around 10% of their brains, but this has been widely discredited by scientists and neurologists. They suggest that the idea of using just 10% of your brain is a myth perpetuated by Hollywood movies and books.
In reality, all parts of our brains are active to some degree at any given time, even when we're not consciously thinking about anything specific. Our brains are constantly processing information from the world around us, whether it's through sensory input or memory recall.
While there may be areas of the brain that we don't use as frequently as others, no one has been able to definitively prove that a small percentage of our brains is completely unused. It's also worth
