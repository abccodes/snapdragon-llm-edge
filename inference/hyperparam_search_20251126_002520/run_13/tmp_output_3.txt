 I asked my friend. He replied, "The seeds are the hottest." This answer confused me because I thought that the white pithy stuff inside the seed (the inner flesh) was hotter than the actual seeds themselves.
To determine which part of a chili pepper is the spiciest, we need to understand how heat in peppers is distributed. Chili peppers contain capsaicin, an alkaloid compound that produces a burning sensation when it contacts skin or mucous membranes.

Capsaicin is mainly found in the white pithy stuff inside the seeds (the inner flesh) of chili peppers. This part is often referred to as the "white pith" or the "pulp." The outer layer of the pepper, including the red skin and the membranes that separate the seeds, also contains capsaicin but usually in lesser amounts.

The actual seeds themselves contain less capsaicin compared to the white pithy stuff. This is why some people might find the inner flesh hotter than the seeds when they are eating chili peppers.

In summary, while both the white pith and the seeds of a chili pepper contain capsaicin, the white pith is generally considered to be the spiciest part due to its
