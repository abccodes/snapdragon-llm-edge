 is a question that many people have. Fortune cookies are a popular treat in the United States, but their origins are not well known.
Fortune cookies were first introduced to America in the late 19th century by Chinese immigrants who settled in San Francisco. At that time, Chinese immigrants were often discriminated against and faced many challenges in their new country. To help them cope with these difficulties, they began to give each other small pieces of paper with good wishes or advice written on them.
These pieces of paper became known as "fortune cookies" because they were meant to bring good fortune to the recipients. Over time, fortune cookies became a popular treat at Chinese restaurants and bakeries in America, and they are now enjoyed by people all over the world.
So, to answer the question, fortune cookies originated in China and were first introduced to America in the late 19th century by Chinese immigrants. They have since become a beloved treat around the world. [end of text]
