However, some people believe that MSG can cause various health problems, such as headaches, nausea, and even serious conditions like seizures. Some studies have suggested that MSG may be harmful to humans in small doses, but the evidence is not conclusive. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about whether MSG is harmful or not. [end of text]
