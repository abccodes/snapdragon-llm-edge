 asks a curious child. To answer this question, we need to understand the basic biology of worms and how they function.

Earthworms are segmented animals that have a simple body structure. They consist of many segments, each with its own set of muscles and organs. The head of an earthworm is where it has its mouth and eyes, while the tail end is where it has its anus and reproductive organs.

When an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will not survive for very long. This is because the head and tail ends of an earthworm are connected to each other by a network of nerves and blood vessels. If the head and tail ends are separated, these connections will be severed, and the two halves will no longer be able to communicate with each other.

Without communication, the two halves of an earthworm will not be able to coordinate their movements or exchange nutrients. As a result, they will both die within a short period of time. The head half will likely die first because it is responsible for controlling the body's functions, and without this control, the body will begin to shut down.

In summary, if an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will not survive for very long because they are connected
