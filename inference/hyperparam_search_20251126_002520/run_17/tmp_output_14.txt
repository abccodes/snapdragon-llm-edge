 According to the story as told in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, Adam and Eve were tempted by a serpent and ate from a tree called the Tree of Knowledge. This act led to their expulsion from the Garden of Eden and brought about original sin. The fruit was not explicitly named as "forbidden" but rather it represented knowledge that would separate them from God's direct guidance. [end of text]
