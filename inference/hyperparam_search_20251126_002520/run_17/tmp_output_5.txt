Matadores, or bullfighters, traditionally use red capes as part of their performance. The color red is believed to attract bulls and make them more aggressive, which adds excitement to the show for spectators.
However, it's worth noting that not all matadors use red capes in their performances. Some modern bullfighting techniques involve using other colors or even non-traditional materials such as plastic bags or balloons.
In addition, some countries have banned traditional bullfighting due to concerns about animal welfare and the impact on tourism. In recent years, there has been a trend towards more humane forms of entertainment that do not involve animals, such as acrobatics or street theater. [end of text]
