 The answer is California.
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the data and identify which U.S. state produces the highest number of peaches.

1. **Identify Relevant Data**: 
   - We have a dataset that includes the total production of various fruits in different states over several years.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Summarize the total peach production for each state.
   - Compare these sums to find which state has produced the most peaches overall.

3. **Comparison and Conclusion**:
   - After analyzing the data, it becomes clear that California consistently ranks as the leading producer of peaches across different years.

Thus, based on our analysis, we can conclude that:

- The U.S. state producing the most peaches is **California**.

This answer is supported by comprehensive data available from various sources such as USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service or specific reports focusing on fruit production in individual states. [end of text]
