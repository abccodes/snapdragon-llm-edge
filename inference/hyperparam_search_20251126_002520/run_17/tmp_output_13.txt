 The answer depends on the species of worm and how it's cut. For example, nightcrawlers (Eisenia fetida) can regenerate their heads after being cut into two pieces. However, many other types of worms will not survive such a procedure. It's important to note that cutting an earthworm in half is generally considered cruel and should be avoided if possible. Earthworms play an important role in soil health by aerating the ground and breaking down organic matter. Therefore, it's best to handle them with care and respect for their natural habitat.
