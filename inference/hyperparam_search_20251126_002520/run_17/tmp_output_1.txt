 Fortune cookies originated in China and were introduced to the United States during the late 19th century. They became popular as a dessert at Chinese restaurants and eventually spread throughout the country.
Fortune cookies are typically made of flour, sugar, butter, and egg white. The dough is rolled into thin sheets and then cut into small squares or circles. Fortune messages are written on slips of paper that are placed inside each cookie before it's baked.
Today, fortune cookies can be found in many different types of desserts and snacks. They have become a popular symbol of Chinese culture and continue to be enjoyed by people around the world. [end of text]
