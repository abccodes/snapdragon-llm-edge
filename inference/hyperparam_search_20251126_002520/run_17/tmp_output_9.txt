 - A 10-year-old's question.
Chameleons are fascinating creatures with the unique ability to change their skin color. This adaptation serves several purposes, including camouflage and communication.

**Camouflage:** Chameleons can blend into their surroundings by changing their skin color. For example, they might turn green when on a leafy branch or brown when in sandy areas. By doing so, they become less visible to predators and prey.

**Communication:** Changing colors also helps chameleons communicate with other members of their species. Different shades and patterns can indicate various emotions such as aggression, fear, or interest. For instance, some chameleons might turn bright red when threatened to warn off potential threats.

These are just a couple of reasons why chameleons change colors. Their ability to do so is one of the most remarkable features in nature! [end of text]
