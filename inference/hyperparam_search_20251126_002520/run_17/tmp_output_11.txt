 Answer: White. The Sun appears white to observers on Earth because it emits light across a broad spectrum of colors, including blue and red. However, when observed from space with instruments that can detect specific wavelengths of light, scientists have found that the Sun's surface temperature ranges between 5,400 Kelvin (9,632 degrees Fahrenheit) and 7,180 Kelvin (12,632 degrees Fahrenheit). This high temperature causes the Sun to emit most of its energy in the visible spectrum as white light. Additionally, the Sun emits some ultraviolet radiation that is absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, which can give it a slightly yellowish tint when viewed from space. Overall, while the Sun appears white to observers on Earth due to its broad spectrum of emitted light, it has a temperature range and energy output that causes it to appear bright white or slightly yellow in other contexts.
