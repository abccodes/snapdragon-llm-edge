 That's a question that has been debated for decades, and it's something that people often wonder about when they visit New York City. The answer to this question is quite surprising!
Firstly, let's talk about how high up the Empire State Building is. It stands at an impressive height of 1250 feet (380 meters) above sea level. Now, imagine dropping a penny from that height. What would happen?
Well, if you were standing right below where the penny falls, it might land on your head! That's because the force of gravity will cause the penny to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s^2 (32 ft/s^2). This means that after just one second, the penny would be traveling at a speed of about 9.8 meters per second.
By the time it reaches the ground, the penny would have traveled a distance of around 47 meters (150 feet) and reached speeds of up to 36 m/s (120 ft/s). That's pretty fast for such a small object!
But what about you? If you were standing right below where the penny falls, it might land on your head! So, while dropping
