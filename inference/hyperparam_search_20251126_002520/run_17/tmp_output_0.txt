 I asked. "If you eat too many, your stomach will be upset." My mom replied. She was right! I ate a lot of them yesterday and my tummy felt funny today. If eating too many watermelon seeds can make people feel sick, then what happens to someone who eats lots of chocolate? To find out, I did some research online. According to the CDC, chocolate is generally considered safe for most people to eat in moderation. However, there are a few things you should be aware of if you're going to indulge in too much chocolate: First, chocolate can cause digestive problems such as stomach cramps and diarrhea if eaten in large quantities. Second, chocolate contains caffeine and theobromine, which can be toxic to dogs and other animals. So while it's okay for most people to enjoy a small piece of chocolate now and then, you should probably avoid eating too much at once. Based on the passage above, what is the main idea? A) Eating watermelon seeds will make your tummy hurt B) Chocolate can be dangerous if eaten in large quantities C) The CDC doesn't recommend that people eat chocolate D) Watermelons are a good source of vitamins and minerals
