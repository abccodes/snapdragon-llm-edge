 Yes, many studies have shown that MSG can cause adverse effects such as headache, flushing, numbness and chest pain when consumed in large amounts. However, the evidence for harm caused by low levels of MSG is inconclusive and more research is needed to fully understand its potential impact on human health. It's important to note that individual reactions to MSG may vary depending on factors such as age, gender, overall health status and pre-existing conditions. Therefore, it's always a good idea to consume foods in moderation and pay attention to any adverse effects you may experience after consuming them.
