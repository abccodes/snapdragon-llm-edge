Many people believe that humans only use a small fraction, such as 10%, of their brains, but this belief has been debunked by neuroscientists.

In reality, it's not possible to accurately measure the percentage of brain activity in any given individual because our thoughts and actions are constantly changing, making it difficult to isolate specific areas or functions. Additionally, there is no clear dividing line between "used" and "unused" parts of the brain; every region has some level of neural activity at all times.

While certain regions may be more active during particular tasks or states (such as when we're sleeping or focused on a task), this doesn't mean that those areas are "turned off" in other situations. Instead, different networks and pathways within the brain work together to support various functions throughout the day.

In summary, there is no evidence to suggest that humans only use a small fraction of their brains, and it's not accurate or helpful to make such claims. Understanding how our brains function requires a more nuanced understanding of neural activity across the entire organ rather than focusing
