 asks a young child. The answer is that light travels in waves and has different wavelengths, with shorter wavelengths appearing as blue or violet and longer wavelengths appearing red.
But this explanation doesn't help the child understand why veins appear blue under certain lighting conditions. To explain it to them, you can use an example of how sunlight appears white when passing through the Earth's atmosphere but takes on a more orange hue at sunset because some colors are absorbed by the air.
Veins in the skin reflect light differently than other parts of the body and absorb different wavelengths. When sunlight hits a vein, it is reflected back to our eyes, and we perceive its color based on which wavelengths were absorbed or not absorbed by the blood in that area.
In areas with less pigmentation, such as veins near the surface of the skin, more blue light is reflected back to our eyes because red light is absorbed. This makes the vein appear blue under certain lighting conditions.
However, when sunlight hits a darker object like a tree or building, some wavelengths are absorbed and others are reflected back to our eyes. The reflection of blue light from this dark surface can make it appear as if there's an additional source of blue light, which in turn gives the impression that veins near the skin
