 I asked.
A young woman replied, "I get a chill. "
Then I wondered: what exactly is happening when someone gets chills after going outside in the cold while their hair is wet?
The answer lies partly in our understanding of how heat and cold work in the body, and partly in how we perceive them.
Heat works by transferring energy from one object to another through conduction, radiation or convection. Heat can also be transferred through evaporation, which occurs when a liquid turns into gas and takes some of that energy with it.
When you get wet in the cold weather, your body's first response is usually to shiver. Shivering helps generate heat by contracting muscles rapidly, increasing blood flow to vital organs and producing more body heat. However, if your hair is still damp when you go outside, this can actually work against you.
Wet hair acts as an insulator, trapping warm air close to the skin and preventing it from escaping into the cold environment. This means that even though your body may be generating extra heat through shivering, some of that warmth will remain trapped in the wet hair.
As a result, when you go outside with damp hair after being exposed to cold weather, you are more likely to feel
