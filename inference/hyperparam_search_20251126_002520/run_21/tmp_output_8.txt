 The answer is Georgia. Georgia is known as the "Peach State" due to its warm climate and fertile land, which are ideal for growing peaches. In fact, Georgia is often referred to as the "Kingdom of Peach." Other states that produce large quantities of peaches include California, Florida, and South Carolina. However, Georgia remains the top producer of peaches in the United States. [end of text]
