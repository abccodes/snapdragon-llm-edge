 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or observations about the actual color of the sun. However, based on scientific knowledge, the sun appears white when observed from space. This is because the visible light spectrum emitted by the sun is a broad range of wavelengths that our eyes perceive as white. The sun's surface temperature is approximately 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit), and it emits most of its energy in the form of visible light and ultraviolet radiation. The color of the sun can vary slightly depending on the observer's location, time of day, weather conditions, and other factors. [end of text]
