 Fortune cookies are a traditional treat associated with Chinese New Year celebrations. They are typically found in a small paper wrapper and contain a message of fortune or wisdom. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, but they are thought to have originated in China and were brought to the United States by Chinese immigrants in the late 19th century. Today, fortune cookies are enjoyed during Chinese New Year celebrations and are often given as gifts or kept as souvenirs. In some places, they are even used as a form of entertainment, with people guessing the meaning of the messages they contain. While fortune cookies are popular and widely enjoyed, it is important to remember that they are simply a type of baked good and should not be taken too seriously. The messages they contain are not always accurate or meaningful, and should be taken with a sense of humor. Nonetheless, they remain a beloved tradition during Chinese New Year celebrations and continue to be enjoyed by people around the world. [end of text]
