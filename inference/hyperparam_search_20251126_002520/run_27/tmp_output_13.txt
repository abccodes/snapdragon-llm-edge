 asks a young boy in the video. The answer is a short and clear demonstration.
The video shows an earthworm being carefully cut in half with a pair of scissors, and the result is shown in real-time. The boy is then asked if he noticed anything unusual, and he responds that he did not notice anything different about the halves. The video then shows the halves of the earthworm moving independently of each other, with one half moving forward and the other backward. The video concludes by asking the boy if he thinks this is a normal thing for an earthworm to do, and he responds that he does not know.
The video is educational and informative, and it is a great way to show children the workings of the earthworm and how they can be affected by being cut in half. It also shows that the earthworm is a very resilient creature and can survive even when cut in half. The video is a great tool for teaching children about nature and the fascinating creatures that live in it. It is also a great way to spark their curiosity and encourage them to ask questions. Overall, it is a great video that will leave a lasting impression on the viewer. [end of text]
