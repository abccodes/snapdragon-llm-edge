 asked a friend.
I replied, 'I'd be killed instantly.'
But my friend replied, 'No, you wouldn't! A penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building would strike you at about 600 miles per hour. That's more than fast enough to kill you.'
I then explained that the penny would shatter on impact and cause minor injuries.
My friend, not convinced, said, 'I disagree. The penny would be traveling at such a high velocity that it would slice through flesh, like a knife.'
I explained that the penny would shatter into hundreds of pieces and that the fragments would cause more injuries than the penny itself.
My friend was still unconvinced, so I decided to make a demonstration. I asked my friend to throw a penny at me from about 20 feet away. He did so, and the penny hit me in the arm. I explained that it would have had the same kinetic energy as a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, but that it didn't hurt because it was soft and couldn't cause significant damage.
My friend was finally convinced, but I was left wondering. What would really happen if a penny were dropped from the top of the Empire State
