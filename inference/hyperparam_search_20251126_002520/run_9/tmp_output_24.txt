**Answer:** **Watergate Scandal**

Nixon referred to this phrase as part of his defense against allegations that he had been involved in cover-ups related to the 1972 break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters (nicknamed "the WaterGate") and other political matters. The scandal eventually led Nixon's resignation from office on August 8, 1974. [end of text]
