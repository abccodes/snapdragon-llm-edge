Veins are usually visible under the skin because they have thinner walls and contain less blood than arteries. The color of a vein depends on how much light is reflected back to your eyes as it travels through its tissue.

Because most people's skin has more melanin, which absorbs red wavelengths (the longest part of white light), blue colors are not absorbed well by the flesh and therefore appear more vividly under our skin than other colors. This means that veins look bluish because they absorb less red light and reflect back a higher proportion of blue wavelengths to your eyes.

However, it's important to note that this is just an approximation and may vary depending on factors such as lighting conditions or the thickness of one’s subcutaneous fat layer.
