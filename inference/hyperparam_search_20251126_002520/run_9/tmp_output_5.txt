 - A brief explanation of the tradition.
The use of a cape is an ancient practice in bullfighting, and it has been associated with Spain for centuries. The exact origins of this custom are unknown, but one theory suggests that it was introduced by Roman soldiers who used to wear similar cloaks when fighting bulls.

In modern-day Spanish culture, red capes have become synonymous with the sport of bullfights. However, there is a common misconception among non-Spaniards about why matadors wave these particular colored fabrics.
The truth behind this tradition lies in their symbolism and meaning within cultural contexts beyond Spain's borders. The color red has historically been associated with courage, bravery, passion, and love – traits that are often considered desirable qualities for bullfighters.

Additionally, the shape of a cape is designed to create maximum surface area contact between it and the animal during combat, which helps in controlling its movements effectively.
In summary, while matadors wave these capes due to their practical use on bulls, they also carry cultural significance and symbolism associated with bravery and courage. [end of text]
