 Answer: White. The Sun appears white to us because it emits a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light in all colors of the rainbow.
Additional information:
The appearance and temperature of celestial bodies can vary greatly depending on their distance from Earth and other factors such as atmospheric conditions or cloud cover. However, when viewed directly from space without any interference, most objects appear white to our eyes due to a combination of reflected sunlight and inherent radiance properties.
It's worth noting that the Sun is not actually "white" in color - it appears yellowish-white because human perception tends to emphasize certain wavelengths more than others. The actual spectrum emitted by the Sun covers all visible colors, as well as ultraviolet (UV) light at shorter wavelengths and infrared radiation at longer wavelengths beyond what we can see with our eyes.
So while from space it may appear white or slightly yellow due to atmospheric effects like scattering of sunlight in Earth's atmosphere, when viewed directly without any interference the true color spectrum emitted by the Sun is actually a broad range including all visible colors. [end of text]
