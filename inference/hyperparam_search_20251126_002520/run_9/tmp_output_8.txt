 The answer is Georgia, which accounts for about 70% of all American peach production.
According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), in fiscal year 2019-20, Georgia produced a total of nearly 538 million pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables. Of this amount, peaches accounted for more than one-third or about 74% of all peach production.
Georgia's climate is ideal for growing peaches, with hot summers that are perfect for ripening the fruit on trees. The state also has a long history of cultivating peaches dating back to colonial times when it was first cultivated in Georgia by Spanish settlers in the late 16th century.
While other states such as California and Florida produce significant amounts of peaches, they typically account for only about one-fifth or less than that produced by Georgia. Other top-producing peach-growing regions include South Carolina, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, New Jersey, Virginia, North Dakota, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Washington.
The popularity of peaches in the United States is reflected in their widespread consumption across all age groups and income levels. They are often consumed fresh or made
