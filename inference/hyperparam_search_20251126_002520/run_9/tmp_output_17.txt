The newspaper reports that experts say people shouldn't swim straight after they have eaten. They suggest waiting at least an hour before plunging into water to avoid cramping or other digestive problems.
Dr Mark Hyman, who runs The UltraWellness Center in New York City says: "Swimming right away can cause a problem because your blood goes down towards the legs and it's harder for your stomach to digest food. "

According to an article on BBC.co.uk titled 'Afternoon tea or afternoon dip?', Dr Sarah Jarvis of Public Health England advises waiting at least 2 hours after eating before swimming.
She says: "Some people find they get cramps in their tummy if they swim straight away, especially when the water is cold. So it's best to wait a couple of hours."
