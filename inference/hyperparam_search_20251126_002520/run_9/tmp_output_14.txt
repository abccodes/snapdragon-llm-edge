 According to the story as told in Genesis 2:17-30, there is a tree called "the Tree of Knowledge" that was located at the center of the garden. It had one particular branch with apples on it which were described as being forbidden by God and warned against eating them.

Adam and Eve disobeyed God's commandment to not eat from this fruit, but after consuming it they realized that their nakedness would be exposed if they did nothing about it (Genesis 2:31-34). As a result of the disobedience, Adam was expelled from Paradise as well as his wife. 

The story is interpreted by many religious scholars to symbolize human sin and mortality.

So according to Genesis in the Bible, Adam and Eve ate an apple that was forbidden by God on the Tree of Knowledge. [end of text]
