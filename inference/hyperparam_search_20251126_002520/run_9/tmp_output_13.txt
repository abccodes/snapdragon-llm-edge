 The answer may surprise you!
If a worm were to be split into two, each side would try and rejoin the other. This process works because worms have special tissues called nerves that run along their sides.
These nerve cells are connected together so when one part of the body gets separated from another, it sends signals down both halves. These messages tell the half that has been cut to start moving towards where its partner is located.
The worm will then attempt to find and fuse with its other side until they join back up again into a whole creature once more! This ability allows worms to heal themselves if part of their body gets damaged or lost during life. So next time you see an earthworm, remember that it has the amazing capacity for self-repair!
It's also worth noting that this process is not always successful and sometimes one half will simply die instead.
