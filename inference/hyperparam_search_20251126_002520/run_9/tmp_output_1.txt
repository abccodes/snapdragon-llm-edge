 Fortune Cookies were invented in the United States. They originated from China but became popular with Japanese immigrants who settled on the West Coast during World War II.
Fortune Cookie, also known as Kuih bangkit or Pak kway teow (in Chinese), is a sweet cookie that contains messages of good fortune and blessings for people eating it. These cookies are traditionally made in Japan, though they have become popular worldwide due to their association with American culture.

In Japanese cuisine, Fortune Cookies come in many different flavors such as chocolate chip, vanilla bean extract, peanut butter, or even savory varieties like teriyaki chicken nuggets! In Chinese tradition, the most common flavor of fortune cookies is almond-flavored. They are often served at events and celebrations to bring good luck and prosperity.

Fortune Cookie has become a popular treat in American culture as well due its association with Chinese-American food traditions during World War II when Japanese immigrants settled on the West Coast.
Today Fortune Cookies can be found all over the world, from Asian restaurants to Western bakeries. They are often used for special occasions such as weddings and New Year's celebrations.

So if you're ever feeling down or in need of a bit of good luck fortune cookies could just do it! Enjoy
