 is a question that can be answered using reasoning and knowledge about agriculture in different states of America.

To answer this, we need to consider which US State has historically been known for its peach production. Peach cultivation requires warm climates with long growing seasons, so it's typically found in southern parts of the country where temperatures are consistently high enough throughout most of the year.

Based on historical data and current agricultural practices:

1. Georgia is often considered one of America’s top producers of peaches.
2. California also produces a significant amount but usually ranks behind Georgia due to its climate being more suitable for other crops like almonds, grapes, etc., which are in high demand.
3. South Carolina has been known historically as the "Peach State," and it continues to be one of America's leading producers.

However, if we consider current production data from 2019:
- Georgia: Approximately 47% (about 58 million pounds)
- California: About 26%
- South Carolina: Around 3%

Therefore, based on the most recent available information:

**Georgia produces more peaches than any other U.S. state by a significant margin.**

So to answer your question:
The **U.S. State that produces
