 is a question that many people have asked. Chameleon color changes are caused by the combination of pigments and structures in their skin.
Chamaleon's ability to change its color comes from special cells called chromatophores, which contain different colored pigment granules. These chroma-photoreceptors can be moved around within a layer under the outermost layers of chameleon’s skin. When these photoreceptor move closer together they appear darker and when spread apart they become lighter.
Chameleons also have specialized cells called iridophores, which are responsible for producing metallic-looking colors in their scales. These structures reflect light at different angles to create a shimmering effect that can change the color of chameleon's skin even further.
In addition to these structural changes, some species of chamaeleon use behavioral cues such as body posture and tail movements to communicate with other members of its group or potential mates.
Overall, it is fascinating how chameleons are able to constantly adjust their appearance in order to blend into different environments or convey specific messages. [end of text]
