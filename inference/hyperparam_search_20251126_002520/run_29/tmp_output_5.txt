 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question can be found in the history and culture of bullfighting.
The use of red caps, also known as "muletas" or "banderillas", has been an integral part of bullfighting for centuries. These colorful capes are used by matadors during their performance to distract bulls from attacking them directly and give themselves time to move in closer for the next phase of the fight.
The red color is believed to be particularly effective because it draws attention away from other colors that might confuse or irritate a bull, such as black. Additionally, many people believe that the bright color of the capes makes bulls more aggressive, which can help create an exciting and dramatic atmosphere for spectators.
While there are some variations in how red caps are used during different types of bullfighting performances, they remain one of the most recognizable symbols associated with this traditional Spanish sport. [end of text]
