 asks a teacher. A student answers, "Because it's too bright." The correct answer is that sitting closer makes objects on TV appear larger and more detailed.
To explain this phenomenon in simple terms:
When an object is farther away from your eyes, its image appears smaller because light rays have further distance to travel before reaching the retina of your eye. Conversely, when you move closer to a distant object, it seems bigger as there are fewer gaps between incoming photons (light particles) and thus more information reaches your brain.
This principle applies not only to TV screens but also to other objects in our environment. For example:
- A tree that is far away appears smaller than one close by
- The moon looks much larger when you're standing on the beach compared with looking at it from a city street

Understanding this concept can help explain why some people find certain things more visually appealing or interesting, and also how to make objects appear closer in photos or videos. [end of text]
