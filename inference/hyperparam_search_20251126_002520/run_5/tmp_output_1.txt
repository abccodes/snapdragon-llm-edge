 is a question that many people have. Fortune cookie originated in China, and the earliest records of them can be traced back to 19th century America.
Fortune Cookies are usually made from flour dough or rice paper wrapped around sweetened almond paste with various fillings such as chocolate chips, peanuts, dried fruit pieces etc., then baked until golden brown. The filling inside is often a piece of written fortune in Chinese characters which can be read and interpreted by the person who receives it.
Fortune cookies are popular during holidays like New Year's Eve or weddings because they symbolize good luck and prosperity for those receiving them. They have also become an important part of American culture, especially among Asian Americans.
Today, Fortune Cookies are widely available in many restaurants around the world, not just Chinese ones. Many people enjoy eating these cookies as a treat during special occasions or simply to satisfy their cravings for sweet snacks. [end of text]
