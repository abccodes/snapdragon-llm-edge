 This question is often asked to test one's knowledge about physics and safety. While it may seem like an unlikely scenario, there have been instances where people have fallen victim to falling objects.
The answer depends on various factors such as how high up you are when struck by a penny dropped from above, the weight of the object, and your reaction time. However, in general terms, if someone were hit by a penny dropped from 102 stories (the height of the Empire State Building), it would likely result in serious injury or even death.
The impact force depends on several factors such as how high up you are when struck by an object falling at terminal velocity and your reaction time. At Terminal Velocity, objects fall through air with a constant speed due to gravity pulling them down while drag from the surrounding medium (air) pushes back against their motion. The faster they move, the more force is exerted on any surface that comes into contact with it.
In general terms, if someone were hit by an object falling at terminal velocity and weighing 10 ounces or less (the weight of a penny), the impact would likely result in serious injury or even death due to the high speed. However, the exact outcome depends on various factors such as
