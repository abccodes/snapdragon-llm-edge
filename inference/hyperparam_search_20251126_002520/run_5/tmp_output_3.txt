 This question has been asked many times, and there are several different opinions on which part of the chile pepper is actually spicy. Some people say that it's the seeds or even just touching them can make your mouth burn! Others believe that it’s the white membrane surrounding the seed.
The truth is, all parts of a chili pepper contain capsaicin – an alkaloid compound responsible for its pungent flavor and heat sensation. Capsaicin binds to pain receptors in our mouths, causing us to feel hot or burning sensations when we eat spicy foods. The concentration of capsaicin varies from one type of chile peppers to another.
The seeds are indeed the hottest part because they contain more capsaicin than other parts of a chili pepper. However, touching them can also cause you pain due to their high content of this compound. In fact, some people have reported that even handling or rubbing the skin on which chilli has been grown can make your mouth burn.
The white membrane surrounding the seeds is actually called "pith" and it contains less capsaicin than other parts of a chili pepper. However, touching the pith may still cause you to feel burning sensations due to its high concentration of this compound.
