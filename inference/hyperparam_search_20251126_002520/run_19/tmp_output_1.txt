 is a question that many people have. Fortune cookies are often associated with Chinese cuisine, but the truth is more complex.
Fortune cookies were not originally from China. They were actually invented in Japan and then spread to other parts of Asia before reaching America.
The first recorded mention of fortune cookies was in 1896, when they appeared at a Japanese restaurant in San Francisco. At that time, they were called "manjū" or "bunshō," which means "fortune cookie."
Fortune cookies became popular in the United States during World War II, when many Japanese Americans were interned and their businesses were closed. The Chinese community took over these restaurants and began serving fortune cookies as a way to show support for their fellow Asian Americans.
Today, fortune cookies are enjoyed by people all around the world, but they still have roots in Japan and China. They continue to be an important part of many cultures' traditions and celebrations. [end of text]
