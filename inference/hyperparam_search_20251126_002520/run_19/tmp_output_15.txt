There have been studies on the effects of MSG on humans, but most of them are observational studies or case-control studies, which cannot conclusively prove whether MSG is harmful to the human body in small doses. Some animal experiments also show that MSG may be toxic to some animals at high concentrations, but there is no evidence to suggest that it can cause harm to humans.
Therefore, although there have been some concerns about the safety of MSG, most scientific studies do not support the idea that MSG is harmful to human health in small doses. However, if you are sensitive to MSG or have any other food allergies, it is recommended to avoid consuming foods containing MSG. [end of text]
