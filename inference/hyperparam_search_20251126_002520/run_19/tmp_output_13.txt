 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question is quite surprising.
When an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will continue to grow and develop normally. This is because earthworms are capable of regenerating their bodies after being injured or damaged.
The process of regeneration in earthworms begins with the formation of a callus at the site of injury. The callus helps protect the wound from infection while allowing new tissue to form. As the callus grows, it pushes outwards and forms a tube-like structure called a blastema. This blastema contains undifferentiated cells that can differentiate into any type of cell in the body.
As the blastema grows, it begins to produce new tissues such as muscles, nerves, and organs. The newly formed tissues then begin to function normally, allowing the earthworm to continue its normal activities after being cut in half.
It's worth noting that not all parts of an earthworm can regenerate. For example, if a worm is cut off at the head or tail end, it will be unable to regrow these areas and may die as a result. However, most other body segments can regenerate.
In summary, when an earthworm is cut in half,
