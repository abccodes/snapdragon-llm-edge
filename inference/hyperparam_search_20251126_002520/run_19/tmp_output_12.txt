 is a question that can be answered by using reasoning and knowledge about music history.

To answer this question, we need to understand who composed "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" and when it was written. 

The song has been around for over two centuries, with the earliest known version being published in 1780. The tune is believed to have originated from a German lullaby called "Auffaenge," which dates back to at least the early 19th century.

However, it's important to note that there are many different versions of this song, and while some people believe that the lyrics were written by an English schoolteacher named William Blake in 1780, there is no definitive proof of this. The most widely accepted theory is that the tune was composed by an anonymous author in Germany around 1805-1820.

So, to answer the question "Who composed the tune of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star?", we can say that it's believed to have been written by an anonymous German composer around 1805-1820. [end of text]
