 is an interesting question that has been debated for many years. The answer to this question can vary depending on how it's measured and what criteria are used.
One common way to measure brain usage is by looking at which areas of the brain become active during certain tasks or activities. This type of measurement, known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has shown that different parts of the brain become more active when performing specific functions such as reading, writing, and problem-solving. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that these areas are being used to their full capacity.
Another way to measure brain usage is by looking at how much energy each area consumes. This type of measurement, known as metabolic imaging, has shown that certain parts of the brain consume more energy than others when performing specific tasks or activities. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that these areas are being used to their full capacity either.
Despite these different methods of measuring brain usage, there is no clear consensus on what percentage of the brain a human typically uses. Some studies have suggested that only about 10% of the brain's neurons are active at any given time, while other studies suggest that up to 95% of the brain may be involved in some way during certain tasks
