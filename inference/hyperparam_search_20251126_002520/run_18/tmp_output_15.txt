MSG has been extensively studied by scientists, and there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that it is harmful to humans in small doses. In fact, many studies have shown that MSG is safe and effective for use in food. However, some people may experience symptoms such as headache, nausea, and flushing after consuming MSG, which are often referred to as "MSG syndrome." These symptoms are believed to be caused by an individual's sensitivity to MSG, rather than a harmful effect of the substance itself. It is important to note that these symptoms are not universal and not everyone who consumes MSG will experience them. [end of text]
