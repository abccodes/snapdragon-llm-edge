 is a question that many people have asked. The answer is that an earthworm is capable of regenerating its body after being cut in half.
When an earthworm is cut in half, the two halves will begin to grow back together. The head of the worm will grow back the tail, and the tail will grow back the head. This process can take several weeks to complete, depending on the species of earthworm and the environmental conditions.
