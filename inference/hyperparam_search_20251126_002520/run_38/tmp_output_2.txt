 asks a young student. The teacher explains that veins appear blue because light travels further in blood than in air, and because the red blood cells scatter red light more strongly than blue light.

However, this explanation does not satisfy the student's curiosity about why blue light travels further in blood than in air. To understand the student's question, we can assume that the teacher knows nothing about the topic and must explain it from scratch.

To help the student understand the answer to the question, we need to use the following information:

* Light travels faster in denser mediums.
* Blood is more dense than air.
* The color of light is determined by its wavelength.

Given this information, can you help the teacher explain why blue light travels further in blood than in air? Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach the explanation:

1. Start by explaining that light travels faster in denser mediums. This means that light will travel farther in blood than it would in air.
2. Next, explain that blood is more dense than air. This means that there are more particles of blood in a given space than there are particles of air. These particles will scatter light more strongly.
3. Finally, explain that the color of light is determined by
