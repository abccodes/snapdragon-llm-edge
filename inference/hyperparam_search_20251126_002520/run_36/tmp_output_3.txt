 What is the hottest type of chile peppers?

Assistant The capsaicin content determines how spicy or hot a chilli pepper is. Capsaicin, which gives chillies their pungent heat, can vary significantly from one variety to another.

The world's spiciest辣椒pepper is considered to be the Trinidad Scorpion Pepper (also known as "Ghost Peppers"), with capsaicin levels ranging between 805,392 and over a million SHU. The Habanero pepper comes in second place at around half that level.

The hottest type of chile peppers can vary depending on the context and what is considered 'hot'. Some people may consider certain varieties to be hotter than others based on their personal taste preferences or experiences.
It's important to note that while these chili peppers are extremely hot, they do not cause any permanent damage to your tongue. The heat from辣椒peppers will go away after a few minutes and does not leave long-lasting effects.

If you're looking for some deliciously spicy foods without the extreme burn of super-hot chilli peppers, there are plenty other options available such as fiery sambal, hot sauces or chili con carne dishes that offer great flavor profiles
