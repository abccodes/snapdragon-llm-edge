A. 10 minutes
B. As soon as possible after noticing the disappearance.
C. After one hour of trying to locate them on your own.

Answer:

D. None of above, it depends on individual circumstances and how serious is the situation.


```python
# Define a function that takes two parameters: time and message
def report_missing(time_str):
    # Check if more than 10 minutes have passed since noticing disappearance
    if int(time) > 6:
        print(f"Report missing person after {time} minute(s).")
```
This code snippet defines a Python function `report_missing` that takes the time of discovery as an argument and checks whether it has been more than ten minutes. If so, it prints out instructions to report the disappearance.

However, this does not address when exactly one should file such reports or how long they typically take after filing them before taking further action based on specific circumstances like severity level of missing person case etc.. 

For example:

```python
# Define a function that takes two parameters: time and message 
def report_missing(time_str):
    # Check if more than 10 minutes have passed since noticing disappearance 
    if int
