 The answer to this question is often cited as 10%, but it's important to understand that while we may not be using all parts of our brains at once, there are many functions going on simultaneously.

To provide some context: humans have about 86 billion neurons in their brain. Each neuron can make connections with other cells (synapses), and these synaptic connections allow information to flow throughout the network.

There's also a significant amount of unused capacity within each individual synapse that could potentially be used for more efficient processing or additional functions if needed.
In terms of how much we use, some research suggests that different parts of our brain are active at any given time. For example, when you're sleeping, your cerebellum is still working to coordinate muscle movements and maintain balance.

Overall, it's difficult to say exactly what percentage of the human brain is typically used because there isn't a single answer that applies universally. Instead, we can focus on understanding how our brains work as complex systems with many interconnected parts constantly interacting.
It should also be noted that while 10% usage may have been cited in past studies or popularized by certain beliefs and misconceptions about brain function, it's not supported by recent research findings and is
