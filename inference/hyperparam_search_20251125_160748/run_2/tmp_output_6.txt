This idea was popularized in the 20th century by a book called "Brainwash" by William James Sidis, who claimed that people only use a small portion of their brain capacity. However, this myth has been debunked by neuroscientists and psychologists.
Research has shown that humans use all parts of their brains, even if some areas may be more active than others at any given time. The brain is a complex organ with billions of neurons and synapses that work together to process information and perform various functions.
While it's difficult to determine exactly how much of the brain is used by an individual at any given moment, studies have shown that the brain is highly efficient and constantly adapting to new experiences and challenges. This means that even if some areas of the brain are not being used as actively as others, they are still capable of performing important functions when needed.
