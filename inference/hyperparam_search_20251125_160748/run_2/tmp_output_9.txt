 is a common question. The answer is that chameleons change colors for camouflage, temperature regulation, and communication.
Chameleons are able to change their skin color by contracting or expanding specialized cells called chromatophores. These cells contain pigments that can absorb or reflect light, allowing the chameleon to change its color.
Camouflage is one of the main reasons why chameleons change colors. By blending in with their surroundings, chameleons are able to avoid predators and catch prey more easily.
Temperature regulation is another reason why chameleons change colors. Chameleons use their skin color to absorb or reflect heat, helping them maintain a stable body temperature. For example, a chameleon on a hot day may turn bright red to absorb more heat, while on a cool day it may turn a darker color to reflect more heat.
