 is a question that many people have asked. The answer to this question is quite interesting. Fortune cookies originated in China and were first introduced to the United States during the 19th century. They were originally called "yiheng" and were made of almond cookies with a paper wrapper. The paper wrapper was printed with messages or fortunes. Over time, the fortune cookie evolved and became more popular in the United States.
Fortune cookies are now a popular treat at Chinese restaurants and are often given as a gift during special occasions such as weddings and birthdays. They are also enjoyed by people who simply enjoy eating them for their sweet taste and crunchy texture.
Today, fortune cookies are made with a variety of ingredients including almond flour, rice flour, sugar, and oil. The paper wrapper is usually printed with messages or fortunes, although some modern versions do not have a wrapper at all. Fortune cookies are still popular today and continue to be enjoyed by people around the world. [end of text]
