 Answer: The trails left in the sky by aircraft are composed of water vapor and tiny droplets of ice. These trails, known as contrails, form when warm moist air from the aircraft's engines meets cold air at high altitudes. The water vapor in the air condenses around small particles in the atmosphere to form these trails. Contrails can have a significant impact on climate by reflecting sunlight back into space and cooling the Earth's surface. In some cases, contrails can also contribute to global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Overall, the composition of aircraft trails is an important factor in understanding their impact on the environment. [end of text]
