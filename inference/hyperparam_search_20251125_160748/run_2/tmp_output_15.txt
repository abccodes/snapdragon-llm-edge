 This question is about the safety of monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor enhancer commonly used in food preparation. To answer this question, we need to consider whether there is scientific evidence that conclusively demonstrates MSG's harm in small quantities.

```python
# Define a function to check if MSG has been scientifically proven harmful
def is_msg_harmful():
    # Assume MSG has not been scientifically proven to be harmful in small doses
    return False

# Call the function and print the result
print(is_msg_harmful())
```

This code snippet defines a function `is_msg_harmful` that checks if MSG has been scientifically proven to be harmful. The function currently returns `False`, indicating that there is no scientific evidence proving MSG's harm in small doses. This example serves as a simple demonstration of how to structure and test functions in Python, focusing on the concept of safety assessment in relation to a common food additive. [end of text]
