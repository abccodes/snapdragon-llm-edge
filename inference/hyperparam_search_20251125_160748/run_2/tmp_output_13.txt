 What is the answer?
: If an earthworm is cut in half, it will not survive. Earthworms have no brain or central nervous system, so they do not feel pain when cut. However, the severed sections of the worm will continue to grow and regenerate for a short period of time. The head section of the worm will continue to grow and eventually develop into a new earthworm, while the tail section will also regrow and become a new earthworm. This process can take several weeks or even months, depending on the species of earthworm and environmental conditions. However, the regrowth process is not perfect, and some segments may not survive or may not grow properly. In general, it is best to avoid cutting earthworms or other animals unnecessarily, as this can cause harm to them and disrupt their natural habitats. [end of text]
