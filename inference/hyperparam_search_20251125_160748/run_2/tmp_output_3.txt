

 The hottest part of a chili pepper is the inner white membrane that surrounds the seeds. This is called the "placenta" or "pith." It contains the highest concentration of capsaicin, the compound that makes chili peppers spicy. Some varieties of chili peppers have a placenta that is more pungent than others, while some varieties do not have one at all. The outer skin and flesh of the chili pepper contain less capsaicin and are generally less spicy. However, they can still be hot if the chili pepper has been dried or roasted. [end of text]
