 I'm asking because I want to know if she says "Mirror, Mirror" or "Mirror, Mirror on the wall". Also, I would like to know if these are the same words used in other Disney films. To answer your question, I will need to research the script of the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, as well as any other Disney films that use this line. This information will help me provide you with an accurate answer. Thank you for asking. [end of text]
