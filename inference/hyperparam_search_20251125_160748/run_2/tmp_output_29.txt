 The quote you're referring to is often attributed to Albert Einstein. However, it's important to note that while Einstein made significant contributions to science, he never actually said this particular quote.

The exact words, "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results," were first used by British author G.K. Chesterton in his 1926 book "Orthodoxy." Chesterton's use of the phrase was a commentary on the tendency of people to repeat actions without learning from past experiences.

Albert Einstein, known for his theories of relativity and mass-energy equivalence, is often quoted as saying or implying various things about intelligence, creativity, and scientific inquiry. However, this particular quote about insanity does not appear in any of his writings or interviews.

So while it's a memorable phrase that has been attributed to Albert Einstein, the actual origin of the quote is more closely associated with G.K. Chesterton. [end of text]
