 is a question that many people have asked. The answer is actually quite simple - the red cape is not meant to be an actual weapon, but rather to distract and confuse the bull.
The purpose of the red cape is to create a visual distraction for the bull, making it difficult for the matador to hit its target. By waving the cape in front of the bull, the matador can guide the animal towards him, making it easier to perform his moves.
The red color of the cape is also believed to have psychological effects on the bull, causing it to become more aggressive and unpredictable. This makes it even more challenging for the matador to execute his moves safely.
Overall, the red cape serves as a tool for the matador to control the bull and execute his moves with precision and skill. While it may seem like a dangerous weapon, the reality is that it is simply a tool used to create a visual distraction and guide the bull towards the matador. [end of text]
