### Combined Score

The dashboard calculates a **combined score** that equally weights efficiency and accuracy:

```
combined = (normalized_accuracy + normalized_speed) / 2
```

Where:
- `normalized_accuracy = (accuracy - min) / (max - min)`
- `normalized_speed = (speed - min) / (max - min)`


### CSV not parsing correctly

- Double check CSV format should follow correct pattern.
- Ensure your CSV has headers in the first row
- Check for proper comma separation
- Avoid special characters in headers
